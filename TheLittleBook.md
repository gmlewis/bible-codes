Note from William:
I have recorded these words exactly as given and have listed them by the dates given. I did not know I was writing a book up until recently. Yeshua HaMashiach literally gave me a book from the end to the beginning, yes, backwards as to how a book is normally written, which is an impossible way to write a book. He then had me divide the book into groupings centered around the works of others. Starting on June 19, 2024, the Lord began revealing to me the prophecies in the section called The Bitter Sweet: General Prophecies after June 19, and these are listed at the end of the book. Other men labored and I entered into their works given by the hand of the Lord long ago. Others continued their works and I added my portion and my course is now finished. I stand in awe at what has been given.
The Little Book testifies of its own authenticity and is in complete agreement with itself and all of Scripture, and the handiwork of the Lord is plain to see for all who have eyes to see. I have been completely transparent and all is recorded in this book that is relevant. Every word in this book will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those to whom it is sent. The Little Book of Revelation Chapter 10 is The Everlasting Gospel of Revelation Chapter14.
May you all be blessed and may Yahweh’s grace and mercy rest on you all in eternal salvation through Yeshua HaMashiach, for by his commission I have been sent. Yeshua HaMashiach indicated to me this is no longer my fight and the two witnesses will prophecy 1260 days and the 144,000 will come. Shalom! Shalom!

Forward: A Prophetic Confirmation by J. Leland Earls.
OCTOBER 28, 2024
Hear my words, my people; listen to that which I make known to you in this hour. For am I not coming to you even now as a mighty messenger to reveal to you that which has been hidden for ages and generations? For even now I would reveal to those who have ears to hear that which I have prepared for my body in these end-times. Do you think that I will leave you without direction and knowledge of my purposes for you in these end-times? Do you think that I am unable to choose special messengers through whom to reveal my message and my purpose for you at the consummation of all things? Hear my words: Again, I say, listen to that which I speak to you in this hour. For I now have a little book in my hands, and I am making known the contents of this book to my specially chosen servants.
And what does it say? It says this. My people, I am coming to you by way of my end-time message and purposes, which shall be the consummation of all that I have prepared for you even for many generations and ages. And I will cause you to come into the fullness of that which I have prepared, even the fullness of that which I consummated on the cross when I poured out my life’s blood for you, to confirm the Everlasting Covenant to you, even a covenant of perfection for my people; a covenant that embodies all the fullness of my glory and power for those who are especially prepared to receive.
For I say to you that a few, yes, a remnant, will be prepared to receive this end-time revelation and purpose, which I am now making known. For it is too potent to be received except by a prepared company, even a “little flock,” which shall receive the fullness of the covenant. For you shall walk in these last days in the fullness of that which I have prepared for you. For even now I am giving you a revelation of that which was sealed, ratified, and made available and ready when my life’s blood flowed on Calvary. For is it not written that I spoke the words, “It is finished.”? What was finished? The fullness of my covenant was finished; even then fully wrought out for the full deliverance from all the power of the enemy, and the full entering in of all that I am ready and able to impart, including the abolishment of death. Yes, the full power to overcome all the works of the enemy, and the full glory prepared even from the foundation of the earth for those who are ready to receive and enter in.
But is it now also written that they limited the Holy One of Israel? My children, I AM the holy one of Israel! But men have limited me. They have hardened their hearts to believe lies and thus have failed to fully appropriate all that I have made ready and sealed, ratified, on Calvary’s cross. Yes, I say to you that all things were ready then. But where could I find a people who were ready—who were prepared to fully believe? Yes, none were found, save those like Joshua and Caleb. He that has ears, let him hear! For even here I perceive that your ears are heavy, and I cannot fully reveal to you at this time what this means, but you shall understand before too many days are past.
But now I shall reveal as much as you are ready to receive. For the little book contains much for this day and time. But I must reveal it a little at a time, for even now many of you are as babes just weaned from the milk and are not ready for meat. Others will understand more of that which I speak. So let me prepare you and circumcise your hearts completely to receive this end-time message. For to whom much is given, much is

required. Would you know the contents of this little book? Then prepare your hearts to receive. For little by little shall it be revealed to you as you are ready to receive.
For even now I am preparing a people who shall fully possess the land prepared—who shall cross over Jordan’s tide—who will laugh at the forces of the dragon—even he whose coming is with lying signs and wonders and whose working is like the rushing waters of the Jordan. Consider this, my people! For is it not written that the dragon will come as a mighty flood of death and destruction? And shall not that same dragon come against my people with a flood of lies and deceptions in this day?
But you shall not be overcome, for I will cause the waters to be dammed up while you cross over by my mighty hand to possess the land prepared for you. For truly, this is a good land. And my people have wandered in the wilderness of spiritual desolation long enough. I say to you that the ‘forty of testing’ has been consummated, and a second time my people are coming to the Promised Land. Even now, I am preparing you to cross over in spiritual power. Listen and consider what I say to you. For the little book that I hold in my hands contains all the secrets and mysteries that I would have you to know in these days.
Oh my people, have I not waited longingly for this hour that I might reveal to you that which has been hidden? Is not this the hour that all history has waited for? Is this not that which was spoken of by the prophets, though they themselves understood it not? Oh my people, have you considered the honor and glory accorded you to live in this hour and to partake in this end-time ministry? Oh, that you might be awakened from your lethargy to behold the glory that has been prepared for this hour. Why will you say in your heart that the time is not yet? Why will you wait and not enter in with all of your heart and soul? I say to you, NOW IS THE TIME TO SEEK ME WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART, that I may speak to you in the inner chamber of your heart and make known to you my counsel for this hour. Listen not to those who would seek to discourage you and blind you to that which I speak. Where are those who have the courage to STEP OUT on the waters of difficulty and testing and WALK TOWARD ME WITH FAITH, knowing that I am able to sustain and uphold you in this hour and forevermore, so that you may walk triumphantly above the waters of tribulation and disturbance, which shall try all men in this day? Walk, I say, fixing your gaze steadfastly on me, looking neither to the right nor to the left; looking neither to those around you nor to the turbulent waters that would seek to engulf you.
For I say to you that you will never make it to the end-time calling and awakening until you are willing by faith to step out of the boat of your present ease and security and into the STREAM OF MY DIVINE PURPOSE, letting not the waves of doubt and fear overcome you, nor letting those who prefer to stay in the boat deter you. But COME MY PEOPLE, for I will have those who dare to walk on the waters of that which has never been done before, and meet me as I come to you in power and glory in this day.
Did they not see that it was a body walking on the water and not a spirit as they had supposed? And did not Peter, in his body, walk on the waters? Even so, my people, it is not just the spirit but A BODY OF FLESH that shall be brought to me in this day to do exploits above the waters of human confusion and distress. Are you not the BODY of Christ; are you not my flesh and my bones? So shall you be one with me in this day; so shall we be joined together ON THE waters to go forth in this day, says the Lord. And so shall you be in the coming days, says the Lord, a BODY OF OVERCOMERS—those who have overcome all the emotional defilement of the watery recesses of the enemy and who are walking triumphantly in overcoming power.
My people, hear my words! Are not the acids in the stomach a type of my workings in your midst? Can

you get nourishment from that which is not bread and from that which does not satisfy? I say to you, the workings of My Spirit are necessary for you to receive that which is life-giving. For am I not able to take that which is vital from my Word and cause it to be assimilated into your being so that you shall receive that nourishment which you need? But why will you feed on that, which is not my word? Why will you seek that which you know will not satisfy your innermost being?
I say to you, if you will not seek me wholly and let my Spirit vitalize that which you take into your system, you will find yourselves in a condition spiritually similar to that which is described herein. The workings of my spirit are necessary. Otherwise, you are taking only that which is dead and which will do nothing to bring spiritual vitality to your innermost being. Therefore, heed that which you are reading, for it is true to the pattern of that which is happening to my people today. For it is impossible, in the present condition of the church world, for me to work by my Spirit in such a way that my Word will give life and health and deliverance to all who are in need. Therefore, again, I say, seek me and let me give you that which is necessary for you to live a spiritual life that is vital and full, says the Lord Jesus Christ.
Prophetic Message Given By J. Leland Earls 1923-1991, sometime during the height of the Cold War, which occurred somewhere around 1962.

Prophetic Reception Method:
How I Receive Prophetic Messages
On March 2, 2024, the Lord Jesus Christ began giving me prophetic messages to share with people regarding his imminent appearing for his Church and other topics. These prophecies came to me in what the Bible describes as when “the hand of the Lord” rests on an individual. For me, it’s a deep feeling of heaviness in my spirit, one that will not leave until I finish the message. Christ will impress a few words or phrases in my mind that I can’t shake and won’t forget, and many times I text the phrase to myself so that I remember. When I do sit down and start typing, the Lord will literally show me the Words in my spirit as I type: Yes, at times I have actual visual perceptions of the words, and many times I hear the words as I type, not audibly but in my spirit, and it’s perceived in such a way that is undeniable.
When I make a mistake and type my own thoughts, the words stop until I delete what I added. When I doubt myself and delete a phrase Christ intended to keep, the words stop until I put the sentence back the way it was, and that sentence will not leave my mind until I do. Lately, the Lord has given me very deep doctrinal messages, and he has taken me to specific scriptures. He will put a phrase in my spirit and I will type it out; then I will search the phrase in my Bible, and I will find that the phrase is in a section of scripture. At that point he will indicate to me which scriptures I need to quote, and I will paste them in the narrative, and then the words continue right away. I’m still amazed that the Words the Lord gives me are in perfect harmony with the blocks of scripture he gives me to quote, and the scripture I quote flows with the narrative most times in a way I simply cannot achieve on my own. I have never done anything like this in my life, until now. I typically do not know the fullness of the message until I go back and perform a spelling and punctuation check. At that point I will read it again, and the Lord will have me make minor changes, perhaps add a sentence for clarification, perhaps delete a word and replace it with another, and so forth. Then the heaviness leaves and I know I am finished.
Please note that in all of these prophetic messages, I have never changed anything topical, not ever, not once; and there has never been a major change to content, not ever, not once. The longer prophecies typically take around an hour or less to type, and the refining process may add another hour or two. I do check everything with scripture to make sure I didn’t mangle anything in my human understanding. So far I haven’t, but to be clear: Many of these Words are beyond my understanding when I type them, and I need to go to scripture to learn more based on what I received. Never once have the messages contradicted scripture, though they challenge my understanding of scripture, and I am a student as well. Now, I am a minister and have close to 30 years in scripture and have made many sermons, teachings, and so on. Let me say this from my years of experience: It is impossible for me to type anything of this level and detail in that short amount of time of my own efforts and understanding. It takes me several days, sometimes a week or more, to prepare a longer, detailed sermon, and this is not the same, not at all. This is not of me and is beyond my understanding. The spirit of prophecy has fallen on me, for the Testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
To the Fallen Ones: Now Comes Your Judgment! (Thunders One & Two)
JUNE 6, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach:
My called, chosen, and faithful, hear the Words of your living Lord and savior, even Yeshua the Messiah! The nations in which you live and the histories you have been taught by your Jesuit educators are the backdrop of the great deception, whose full revealing is imminent and already in motion, whereby the fallen ones will appear as benevolent aliens but in truth are malevolent fallen angels. What is it that has been? It is that, that shall be: and what is it that has been done? That which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Satan has offered his so-called advanced knowledge from the beginning, even his knowledge of good and evil. He is a master manipulator and liar who has taught many things to mankind that Yahweh did not intend, for these are the ways of death. Yahweh’s creation is not made to be manipulated for personal power and gain or as a means to escape God’s judgment, nor to establish one’s own ways and order. For Satan has corrupted mankind from the beginning, and he has corrupted the fallen watchers who joined their rebellion.
Oh, you great enemy of all unrighteousness, even you Satans: your initial sins were recorded by Enoch the scribe all this time ago, and they stand to this very day, for your sins were so recorded. And so I will summarize, for you have done these things, and much more have you done: You led astray all the sons of God, and brought them down to the earth, and led them astray through the daughters of men. You imparted to the holy sons of God evil counsel, and led them astray so that they defiled their bodies with the daughters of men. You showed the children of men all the blows of death, and led astray Eve, and showed the weapons of death to the sons of men: the shield and the coat of mail, and the sword for battle, and all the weapons of death to the children of men. And from your hand they have proceeded against those who dwell on the earth from that day and forevermore.
You Satans taught the children of men the bitter and the sweet, and you taught them all the secrets of their wisdom. You instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity to eternity and until this day. For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation to their good faith with pen and ink. For men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous; and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them, but through this knowledge they are perishing, and through this power it is consuming men.
You Satans showed the children of men all the wicked smitings of spirits and demons, and the smitings of the embryo in the womb, that it may pass away, and the smitings of the soul, the bites of the serpent, and the smitings which befall through the noontide heat, the son of the serpent named Tabââ‘ĕt. For you even requested Michael to show you the hidden name, that you might enunciate it in the oath, so that those might quake before that name and oath who revealed all that was in secret to the children of men.

The BITTER SWEET

For you caused the watchers to join your rebellion as you further corrupted mankind. And so the sins of the watchers were so recorded by Enoch the scribe, and I will summarize as follows: They taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. They taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, the resolving of enchantments, astrology, the constellations, the knowledge of the clouds, the signs of the earth, the signs of the sun, and the course of the moon.
And so through your corruptions and lies, you have polluted Yahweh’s creation with your evil ways and blasphemous abominations. You have led mankind astray and sinned against Yahweh, and you have wronged mankind, and even sinned against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and your sins bring great judgment of which you will not recover. You have polluted Yahweh’s creation with your technologies and manipulations, and you caused mankind to wonder after your tricks and falsehoods. For Yahweh only showed you the worthless mysteries of his creation and kept his most precious mysteries hidden in his heart away from your betrayal.
You evil ones taught your worthless ways to mankind as they multiplied on the face of the earth, and you brought great misery and destruction through your evil schemes and technologies. For you come not but to steal, kill, and destroy. You taught manipulation of the air, for you are the prince of the power of the air, for you manipulate the aithēr. For when Cain sinned, he built a city; and you have taught mankind your worthless secrets and manipulations. These cites were used for control and manipulation and to bring about mankind’s destruction, as you used them to make your abominations of destruction.
You have caused nation to rise against nation in war and endless strife, and you caused my people to sin, and Yahweh has scattered the Tribes of Israel to the four winds. No matter, your evil intent has furthered the purposes of Yahweh, for by their scattering will the gathering of the remaining sheep be accomplished. And I will send my two witnesses to prophecy 1260 days clothed in sackcloth. In all your efforts to destroy Yahweh’s children you have failed miserably, and you simply could not see that your efforts furthered Yahweh’s purposes, for even his enemies obey his voice.
For you have persecuted and troubled the 12 tribes all across the earth as you sought their destruction. You have stolen children from mothers, and taken children from families and relocated them across the earth, and then lied to them and caused them to believe Jesuit fables regarding their true history, purposes, and origin. No matter, you have failed, because I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will fully reconnect them with their past, nation and true heritage, and I will make all who are heirs of salvation one new man, even in me, Christ Jesus.
By sleight of hand and great destruction, you have cleverly hidden away your technologies, even telling lies that the people of the past were ignorant and had no technology. For you showed the ancients your worthless mysteries, and there is nothing new under the sun. And so you hide the truth regarding your manipulations of the creation, even hiding them away from those you would seduce with your great deception. You have reintroduced your magic tricks yet once again, as you have set the stage so you can masquerade as aliens. And through your fake alien invasion you will cause all to wonder at your lying signs and wonders, even those whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. But I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will expose you to the uttermost, and every hidden secret will come to light.

Behold! I will snatch away my faithful to the heavens, for I am coming for my Bride and I will not be stopped. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, come to judge and make war and bring great judgment upon the earth, and you will not escape.
I, Yeshua HaMashiach, Lord of Lords and King of Kings, have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent, and all will be fulfilled.
From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God:
Oh, you Satans, you have deceived my creation into following after your lying signs and wonders, and my wrath is hot on you. My people will be utterly separated from your tares that you have sown among my wheat in my garden of grace; and my Son, Christ Jesus, will gather my wheat in my barn, and so the Lord of harvest will gather, bind and burn your tares. Great judgment is upon you, and you will not escape my hand. From the beginning, you slithered and hid yourself among my children, even corrupting my little ones from the very beginning with your lies and deceit.
You are no gods, and those who followed your deception and delusions of victory are no gods either. You cannot create, for you lack the power, and I never created you with such abilities because I knew you would rebel before you were created; and in my justice and love I created you in righteousness, and you were perfect in the day you were created. In your worthless pride you boast of your own greatness, but you have no greatness, and I will fully expose you for the frauds you are. I will lay you in front of Kings, and they will see you and just how powerless you are. My son, Yeshua HaMashiach, utterly defeated you at Calvary, and you have no hope.
You are allowed to do only what I allow, as you are a defeated enemy. You stole the deed to the earth in your trickery and lies to Adam, and now my only begotten son, even Yeshua HaMashiach, has defeated you in his love for me and my creation; and the earth is his, even the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, for I have declared it. For he purchased the earth and mankind with his own sinless blood, and those who choose life will be redeemed. All your worthless works will be undone, and all who choose life will walk out of your lies and deception into newness of life, and I will make the faithful more glorious than you once were. For you have failed, oh weak and beggarly princes of the earth, even every prince in your order has failed along with you, oh slithering, lying serpent.
Now comes the time for your Judgment and your kingdom’s utter destruction, even the kingdom you have built in your efforts to try and hide me, even Yahweh, from my creation. You will not escape. You will never again enter the heavens, for you are cast down to the earth never to return, and your place is in the heavens no more. You are bound to the earth that you lusted after, that was not yours to seize. Every one of your works will be undone in the lives of those you tried to destroy (and on the earth itself); they will forever dwell in peace and safety, and perfect happiness will they have, and I will dwell among mankind and I will be their God.
But you, oh slithering one, are powerless in my gaze, and you can do nothing to stop me. In the six days since the fall of man, for one day is a thousand years in my sight, you have accomplished nothing but your own judgment, damnation, destruction, and torment for you and all who follow. For you will be bound and cast into that great burning lake where I have made the hottest flames for you, even pure flames of blue, and

you will forever burn, and I will recompense to you every evil work you have ever done, many times over. You have murdered multitudes upon multitudes, and you will pay for every soul that has been lost, and never will you escape. You will know all the sins you committed, and you will never escape from judgment, and you will forever be tormented for the sins you have committed. You will know full well your sins and offenses in your torment, and those you hate will have the final victory over you. And all the unrighteous ones whom you ever enticed to sin and commit themselves to join your rebellion, even those whose names were never written in the Book of Life, will share in your torment. You will all pay for every single sin you have committed, for you have sinned against Yahweh and against my creation, and I will repay. For in my justice I will recompense your own sins, actions, and evil ways fully back into your bosoms many times over and for all eternity. And I, Yahweh, even the great eternal God, swears these things by my own name, for I can swear by no greater.
You will serve my purposes, and in your hate and destruction you will drive my chosen to me; for I will lead them by the hand of Yeshua HaMashiach and his army of mighty men, for they will gather my remaining sheep. (Behold! The 144,000 sent by Yeshua HaMashiach will do mighty works in the face of your abominable evil.) And not one whom I have ordained to eternal life will fall to your schemes, for they can never be plucked from my hand, and neither can anyone pluck them from my Son’s hands: For I have given him a name above every name, and he comes in the power of Yahweh himself, for I have shared my throne with him. And he will utterly crush your head. You have failed, little prince, and your time has come.
I, Yahweh, the great eternal God, have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent, and they shall come to pass. For Yahweh, the great eternal God, has so declared, and nothing can break my declarations. I AM El Shaddai!

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
The Testimony of Jesus Is the Spirit of Prophecy. (Explanation of “In the Works of”)
JUNE 4, 2024
Behold, I show you the mystery of the little book. For the book has been given, and the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus. My testimony of Jesus began in my life when the Lord Jesus Christ called me into ministry and service in 1996 when I was living in New York City. I had answered the Lord’s call to repentance by attending a home Bible study group and was a student in one of their classes. One evening I was sitting in a diner in Long Island City with a good friend of mine, and he asked me to turn in my Bible to John 4, and he began to read the following as I read along:
JOHN
4:35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
4:36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
4:37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
4:38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye are entered into their labors.
As my friend read these verses, the words seemed to leap off the page and amplified straight into the depths of my soul. A fire was kindled in my heart, and so the Lord commissioned me into his service in 1996. I literally dropped my entire life and everything I was doing to go into ministry. I became leadership in a smaller mega church, and later, when I found out just how corrupt they really were, I hit the exits never to return in 2008. I struggled for a few years as I tried to walk for Christ, but my sins were holding me back. In 2013 my life fell apart and I self-destructed, and it was a slow-motion train wreck that had been in the making for some time. And so the Lord took me into serious chastisement and scourged me many times over until I returned to sanity on July 7, 2020, when I fully repented of my sins.
The Lord prepared me for this journey by granting me many visions, signs, miracles, several healings, and I have cast out many spirits by the Lord’s direction, and much confirmation has the Lord given me to the genuineness of my ministries and calling. And so I am restored to my Lord, restored to Yahweh, restored to my wife and son and my eternal reward.
Sometime toward the end of 2023, I had something spectacular happen. Many times I will sleep with scripture playing on my TV and soundbar. This particular evening, I went to sleep with the Old Testament playing very softly. I was startled out of sleep in the middle of the night when my soundbar, which had been very quiet, became very loud for no reason out of the blue. Nobody had turned the volume up, and the remote was lying untouched on my nightstand next to my bed. The following verses from Ezekiel played while I sat there in disbelief:

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

EZEKIEL
3:17 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
3:19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
3:20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
3:22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me
And so it has been. Even though at the time I didn’t understand that the Lord was sending me as an endtimes prophet, I would soon find out.
On March 2, 2024, I began typing prophetic messages in what the Lord described to me as the works of John the Baptist. This continued from March 2 until April 5, 2024, and during that time I received 20 prophetic messages. All of the messages centered around judgment on Mystery Babylon, calling the saints to repentance, and announcing the soon appearing of Jesus Christ himself, as he will appear in the air at any time now for the faithful in his Church. I actually thought the prophecy on April 5 was the last one. I was wrong. The next prophetic message occurred on April 10, 2024, and the Lord told me he was sending me in the work of Peter to feed and care for the flock.
The nature and content of the messages changed from that point, though they still contain elements from the first twenty, and many of these messages interrelate one to another. On April 21, 2024, the nature and content of the messages shifted again, and the Lord told me he was sending me in the work of the Apostle Paul as a steward of God’s mysteries. And so the content of the messages shifted again and are built on the previous messages and interrelate. These messages continued along the same lines until May 16, 2024, when the content shifted once more. I was told I was being sent in the works of John the Revelator (a term I’ve never heard or used), and on May 16 those prophecies began.
And so the Lord’s handiwork is expressed in the calling he has given me, and he has sent me where I bestowed no labor; other men labored, and I have entered into their labors. It’s not that these mighty men of God didn’t finish their courses, but that these works have continued since all that time ago when Jesus Christ commissioned them in the works he sent them. These divisions were unknown to me when I started prophesying, and as he told me, I was entering into the works of each one. I never made the connection until it was revealed to me by Yeshua.
The calling and ministries on my life have been fulfilled. Other men labored, and he sent me into their

works, and therein have I labored.
I have been sent in the work of John the Baptist to announce the Lord’s coming. I have been sent in the work of Peter to shepherd and feed the flock.
I have been sent in the work of the Apostle Paul as a steward of the Mysteries of God. I have been sent in the work of John the Revelator to call the 144,000 and show events to come.
Personally, I am not worthy to compare myself to any of these great men of God and am not worthy of my own to even speak a simple greeting to any of you. But the Lord has made me worthy, and I have been sent into these works just the same. My entire life has led to these messages ,and every word will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those to whom they are sent. Should the Lord need me to say more, I will. And so I will finish my course and the works given for me to complete. And with this explanation, the handiwork and signature of the Lord Jesus Christ is revealed in these prophetic messages given to me. I have finished the works he commissioned me to do. And so I wait on the Lord.

Behold! Judgment Comes and the Times Are Now!
JUNE 4, 2024
The times have come for fulfillment, my little ones, even fulfillment of all things concerning Daniel’s seventieth week. For Daniel’s seventieth week is a week of years where each day is a year. Daniel’s seventieth week is about to be fulfilled and will begin as the faithful in my Church are snatched away to meet me in the clouds. The last trump shall sound and with a mighty voice of the archangel the dead in Christ will rise first, and you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds with them, and so shall you ever be with me, even Christ Jesus, for I am the resurrected Nazarene who died to sin once and who dies no more. For my kingdom is from everlasting to everlasting, and of my kingdom there shall be no end, for Yahweh has so declared.
When my faithful are taken into the heavens, so too will the restrainer be removed, and so shall the start of Daniel’s seventieth week begin. Many of you struggle with the concept of me, Yeshua HaMashiach, catching my faithful ones away from judgment that is not intended for them, yet I will cause you to understand, should you come to me with the humility of a little child, even the innocence and curiosity of a little one. For you are my little ones, even my little ones who see through a glass darkly and who prophesy in part. And so I say to you, humble yourselves and repent from your worthless pride, for it is sin, and come to me to learn and accept holy scripture. To reject any section of scripture is sin, for every Word of God is pure and to be received with respect for obedience, and I, Jesus the Nazarene, am the word made flesh.
The gathering of my saints to me in the clouds was a mystery hidden within the great mystery of God. So it was a mystery within a mystery and therefore was not revealed until it was revealed to the Apostle Paul in his letters. To him was revealed the great mystery of God, for Paul was also a steward of God’s mysteries, for so I commissioned him. And so understand that to deny scripture on this event is to deny me and to be among the foolish virgins.
And so I will explain to you many things that are about to come to pass, even continuing the works I gave to John the Revelator, for the testimony of my revealing is written to conceal as it reveals. And so now I will tell you things before they happen so that you are prepared for the days ahead. For I, Christ Jesus, will cause my people to stand in the works where I am sending them so that you may complete to the uttermost the many mighty works I have for you to accomplish.
As the gathering together happens, the restrainer is removed, and great destruction will overtake the earth, suddenly and in an instant. For as the restrainer is removed, nothing will remain to hinder the evil in the world and the lusts and evil passions of mankind. Great war will break across the earth, and brother will once again rise to kill their brother, and great shall their destruction be. Many nations will fall as Mystery Babylon, even that great whore who sits on many waters, will be made desolate in one hour.
That great city, even that nation of many United States, will be utterly destroyed; for she has earned a double portion of judgment, and she is worthy. For she lived deliciously in great sin; she sits in great arrogance thinking she can never fall and things will continue, yesterday as today, and tomorrow ever more the same and unchanging. And the great whore has corrupted the earth with the golden cup in her hand,

19

THE

full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication. And so her judgment will fall suddenly. Great fire will overtake her cities as missiles fall; great shaking will occur, and that nation will split along the middle. Her coasts will be greatly flooded, and never will she rise again, for great are her sins and great is her judgment.
As war breaks across the land and the horseman execute their judgments on the earth, great misery and desolation will come on the world. The world that now is will never again be; when the restrainer is removed, everything will be different. There will be great death, pestilence, great famine, and great injustice; and yet my 144,000 will be protected from wrath and judgment, for they will carry the seal of the Living God, even Yahweh, in their foreheads; for so will they be sealed, and I send my angels to seal them. And so great chaos and lawlessness will rule the day. The first 42 months will be times of great persecution and great trouble, but the great tribulation will happen in the second 42 months: for there are 84 months in the seven days of years of Jacob’s trouble. And so the second half is the great tribulation, but the tribulation and persecution on the land will be horrible for the inhabitants of the earth the entire time.
For neither me, Christ Jesus the Ascended Lord, nor Yahweh, the great eternal God (for there is none like Him), have any pleasure in the coming judgments and troubles. My Father did not create mankind in love so that he could judge and destroy them. Yet, Satan has corrupted God’s garden of grace, and now the corruption will be cleansed away so that righteousness may rule. And so there is no other choice for salvation for those who rejected my call of salvation during the age of grace. People must awaken from their slumber and the pleasures of sin, for there is no more time and now is the time to forever choose, or the choice will be made in judgment for those who reject me by refusing to choose. Many troubles and the coming judgments will awaken many to eternal salvation, even snatching them from the eternal fires; for many are drunk on the pleasures of sin, and so pleasures will be taken away. They will have no more pleasure in these days, and survival will be a minute-by-minute affair at times, and much danger will abound.
So will it be that my faithful and chosen among my Church will be hidden away from the times of Jacob’s trouble in the heavens. And their works will be judged by fire, and whosoever’s works remain will receive reward and whosoever’s works are burned will suffer loss, but they themselves will be saved, so as yet by fire. They will take their places in the order prepared for them in the heavens. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am worthy to take the book and open the seals, and with the opening of the seals the horsemen are loosed. And they will go forth in the earth to conquer, to make war, to cause pestilence and great death. The seven trumpets will sound, woes are coming, and the seven vials of the indignation of the wrath of God will be poured out on the earth in full.
The coming world war will not last for years, because Satan knows that he has but a short time, yet war will be ever present during these times of trouble. Out of the ruins and horrors of war will rise the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth, who is also the false prophet. These two will work in tandem, as they already work in tandem in secret for the destruction of Secret Babylon. And the ten horns, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. (And so the horsemen will ride.)
They will rise offering peace, safety, and false godliness. They will outlaw anything to do with me, Jesus Christ, across the world, and they will make war with the saints and overcome them, for it is given in their

hands to so accomplish. Their so-called aliens will present themselves and will offer their help to mankind, but these are fallen angels bringing great deception. Behold, I bring giants to fulfill my wrath, and so has Yahweh declared. As in the days of Noah, so shall it be for the fallen angels of old; even the so-called gods of old (they are no gods) will seek to rebuild their golden age on the earth, and they are released for judgment, but no golden age will they have. Their abominations will be released, for the restrainer will be gone and fully removed, and nothing shall hold them back. Those who love their lives will lose them eternally, for they will require the mark to participate in their new society, even their new order. And all who take the mark of the beast will have their portion in the lake of fire.
My 144,000 are not sent to live in their cities, where they would have to take the mark to live. But they will be sent to and fro and will gather many to them and care for many and will help bring great multitudes in salvation to me, Yeshua HaMashiach (in whatever language): all who will call on my name until the end shall be saved. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. As in the days of Noah, those who are godly will live outside of their evil fallen-angel society, for theirs will be a society of sin that leads to eternal damnation in the unquenchable fires; so join them not because the choice is permanent. And so my 144,000 will bring salvation and help to many.
They will do mighty signs, miracles, and wonders, and I will lead them step by step, and I will direct their paths to those to whom I am sending them. And I will gather my sheep to them so they may be led to safety. And whosoever loves not their lives to the end will be saved. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
The beast from the sea will rise and will serve the evil purposes of those who rule the land of promise in great sin, even the synagogue of Satan. He will rule the nations and will speak many blasphemies, and will do great lying signs and wonders, and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? The synagogue of Satan will do all they can to destroy anyone who calls on my name, and the beast and the false prophet will brutally enforce Noahide on the nations and will appear as though they are cleansing evil from the land. But they will instead make war with the saints and overcome them, and it is given to the beast from the sea to continue 42 months.
The beast from the earth will rise also from the ashes. He will have all the power of the first beast, and he will do many lying signs and wonders in the sight of the first beast, and he will make an image of the beast, and a spirit will be permitted to cause the image of the beast to speak, saying that whoso will not bow down and worship the image of the first beast should be killed.
For the beast from the earth will they crown king of the lands of promise, and he will be their long-awaited Moshiach, and he will build their temple (even though Yahweh did not commission him), and so it will be. They will receive him as a great, benevolent ruler, prophet, and king. And the beast from the earth (even their false prophet) will cause all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads, And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. They have even conditioned the earth to accept the mark, and the system has been refined during their so-called pandemic.
(It is written in Revelation: And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man

worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receives the mark of his name.)
In the first 42 months, I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
The beast from the earth, even their false prophet, will surely bring the abomination of desolation. He will cause the daily sacrifice to cease and set the abomination of desolation in their place. And so I stated and so Matthew wrote: When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso reads, let him understand), Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains: Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
(Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.)
And so I will protect many and hide many away in the wilderness from the great tribulation, for had the days not been shortened, no flesh would survive. Then the beast and false prophet will gather the kings of the earth and all that stand with them from the dragons’ kingdom for that great day of battle. And so I had John the Revelator write: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it, he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
And the beast and false prophet will both be taken alive and cast into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with

Christ a thousand years.
And so my angel will descend from the heavens, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain with which he will bind Satan in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and set the seal so that he should deceive the nations no more for a thousand years. At the end of my thousand-year reign, Satan will be loosed from the abyss for a little season.
He will go out to deceive the nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog to gather them together as the sand of the sea, and he will attack the camp of saints and surround the holy city, and fire will come down from Yahweh and will utterly consume them. And the devil that deceived them will be bound and cast alive into that great lake of fire, which burns with brimstone in the hottest flames of blue. And there will be great recompense of evil and great justice will be served on the Satan’s own head, his fallen angels, and all who joined their rebellion; and never again will they arise, and they will be utterly forgotten; and never again will they come to mind.
Then Yahweh will make a new heaven and a new earth, and he will make his abode among men, and in peace and harmony will it be forevermore, and never again will there be a time of trouble, and they shall never again sin, neither through pride nor ungodliness, and all their days will be blessed.
I am the resurrected Nazarene who died to sin once and who dies no more.
I am Yeshua, even your true Messiah, whom Yahweh has sent to fulfill the promises made to the Fathers.
I am he whose eyes are a flame of fire ,and on my head many crowns.
I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and in righteousness I come to judge and make war.
I am he who will direct and lead my 144,000, and they will sing a new song that no man can learn.
I am he who will defeat Satan’s kingdom, and I will bruise his head.
I am he whom Yahweh has sent for salvation of all who believe, and my time has come. Behold! Judgment comes and the times are now.

To the 144,000: Repudiate Their Lies
JUNE 2, 2024
Incline your ears to my voice and hear my wisdom, for wisdom cries aloud in the streets: will you hear my voice? I am Yeshua HaMashiach, even the son of Yahweh, who came in the flesh and am the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Understand that the world in which you live is not the false portrait your Jesuit educators painted to lead you astray. Many of you have been indoctrinated into Jesuit lies, even learning against learning. This war on truth was designed to mold the minds of men into submission to Satan and endeavors to remove and usurp man’s free will so that man would mindlessly follow his indoctrination.
True history cannot be understood from the lies of Jesuit philosophers, for they are liars peddling falsehood in great deceit. Scripture is clear on the matter, and Romans declares the truth plainly stated: For the wrath of God appears from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, which withhold the truth in unrighteousness.
Did you let those words reach your heart? Men purposely withhold the truth in ungodliness and unrighteousness, and the wrath of Yahweh is against those who do. So your educations are made spurious by their lies.
They have done this to prepare the way for the coming great deception, and so that Satan’s kingdom can be unleashed to rule in great deception and lies. The lies they have told you for education serve to blind the masses to the truth: There are no aliens, only fallen angels headed for the lake of fire to be bound and burned for eternity. Believe not their lies and run to me, Christ Jesus, for in me dwells the all truth that will make you free. I tell you these things so you will not be deceived with those who will join Satan and receive the coming beastly mark.
History is understood by following truths established in Scripture and extra-Biblical books 1 Enoch, Jasher, Jubilees, et al., from the beginning. For these ungodly men and the lies they use to obscure the truth are simply part of the great war, even the seed war between Yahweh and Satan that rages to this very minute, yet is won for all eternity by my atoning works. For war was declared by Yahweh on that old serpent for his rebellion, even from the beginning of creation of mankind when Satan tried to destroy Adam and Eve. Yahweh stated to the serpent in his declaration: I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel. And so the seed wars have raged ever since.
In the Garden of Eden, Satan managed to corrupt the seed of Adam, condemning Adam under the power and corruption of sin. (In this thing the son of God appeared, that he would undo the works of the devil.) For Satan used his corrupt knowledge of good and evil to utterly corrupt mankind, and for those who obey my voice, that corruption is undone in me, Christ Jesus, in whom you are a new creation that can never be corrupted. My seed cannot be corrupted, for Yahweh has made it incorruptible, and by way of the new birth I have sealed my chosen and faithful even with that holy spirit of promise!

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

John in his first letter declares the eternal truth: Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin: for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
In a short time after the fall of Eden, where Adam sinned and fell from perfection to corruption, the watchers descended on Mount Hermon in the days of Jared. And they all bound themselves by mutual imprecations, even their unholy oath whereby they bound themselves eternally to sin and eternal punishment. They did so in order that they would all take to themselves wives of all they chose, thus changing the order of their nature.
They came to mankind offering their putrid fallen-angel knowledge, for they joined the Satan’s rebellion.
They taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all coloring tinctures. They taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, the resolving of enchantments, astrology, the constellations, the knowledge of the clouds, the signs of the earth, the signs of the sun, and the course of the moon.
So the fallen watchers took their wives and committed fornication with them, and they became pregnant and bore to them great giants. And in time this unholy seed devoured all that was on the earth, and all that was given to mankind, and eventually devoured as much of mankind as they could. For they were blood drinkers and man eaters, and they did great evil in the sight of Yahweh, for the life of the flesh is in the blood and mankind was made in the image of Yahweh. They grew and multiplied and eventually set up their kingdoms across the face of the earth. Behold! The ruins of their megalithic structures still litter the earth as a witness against them. They dominated the earth during those times, and they were made for mankind’s destruction. And so all manners of abominations were achieved, for the holy writings even declare how it was accomplished.
As if it wasn’t enough for mankind to lust after strange flesh, fornicate with fallen angels, and produce giant offspring, because of the watchers they all sinned against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish. From the beginning of creation, Yahweh ordained each life form after its kind. But the evil watchers tampered with creation, even crossing creatures of one kind with creatures of a similar kind to introduce genetic instability and alter Yahweh’s initial creation of harmonious perfection. This process was repeated, crossing similar creatures of one kind with similar creatures of another kind until the desired outcome was achieved. And so the world that then was, became corrupted with all sorts of malevolent abominations who sinned greatly against Yahweh, mankind, and all creation. Understand, the fallen ones want a world of their own, even a world of darkness completely separate from Yahweh, and they will inherit just that in the lake of fire prepared for them by Yahweh himself.
And so the days of Noah came and the world that then was, standing out of the water and in the water, was overflowed with water and perished. For the fountains of the great deep were broken up, causing great violence as the earth was broken apart by the forceful might of the violent waters, and the windows of heaven were opened, allowing waters from above the firmament (and from beneath the earth) to cover and destroy the entire world.
And so Enoch the scribe describes the fate of these giants as such, for Yahweh so declared: And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the

25

THE

earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men, from the holy watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling. And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause offenses. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them. Understand that nine-tenths of these evil spirits are in the abyss due to Noah’s petition and prayer, and mankind has only dealt with one-tenth of them ever since. That is about to change when the abyss will be opened and all will be released.
So the earth, and all the watchers’ abominations, were destroyed. The watchers themselves were chained in their various judgments for seventy generations, to be released for judgment in the time of the great judgment. (For the great judgment is about to begin.) However, Noah found grace in Yahweh’s sight because he was a righteous man, and his family Yahweh saved alive even eight souls total, along with many other creatures on the Ark. Noah kept himself and his family from genetic tampering before the flood. But his son Ham and his evil offspring would eventually reject Noah and even Yahweh himself (who had created and saved them), joining themselves to the Satan’s rebellion.
The words of Genesis 6 were fulfilled by the sins of Noah’s offspring, even the line of Ham. There were giants in the earth in those days: and also after that. “Those days” were the days from Jared to Noah, and “giants in the earth” were the offspring of the watchers and daughters of men before the flood. “After that” is after the days of Noah, when mankind’s genetics were again corrupted by fallen-angel knowledge. I ask you to no longer believe the deception of the erroneous Sethite theory and believe the words of the holy writing, for these words are truth.
When the earth was divided by lot among Noah’s sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth), Ham’s lot was for him to inherit the lands to the south, and so they were his. However, Canaan lusted after a portion of Shem’s inheritance and moved into lands that were not his to occupy. For it was Canaan that Noah cursed. For Canaan left his inheritance and founded the city of Tyre on what became the Phoenician coast and led to Sidon, of which Jezebel descended. He did this so that he could be in proximity to Mount Hermon, where the watchers descended and where I was transfigured.
Canaan found what the watchers left behind before the flood of Noah, because they sought to preserve their rebellion even after the flood, for they carved much into rocks and stones. Canaan used their fallenangel knowledge in great sorceries, and many vile rites were done by the Canaanite, for they even sacrificed their own children. So vile were they and so pervasive that he managed to infect the land of Canaan with his newly made abominations, where Satan worked on account of his transgressions.
And so the tribes of post-flood giants, even the abominable Canaanite tribes, arose from Canaan’s transgressions and iniquities and sorceries. To the land Canaan stole from Shem came the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. They were the terrible ones, even Rephaim. There were more tribes than listed, but these terrible ones were waiting in the land of promise in an effort to kill those who protected the Christ line, even your Israelite ancestors and fathers who were Hebrews.

Joshua entered the promised land to claim what was rightfully given to Shem by lot and the land that rightfully belonged to Israel by promise of Yahweh himself. But the children of Israel did not fully carry out the commands of Yahweh to leave none of the tares alive, for they were malevolent and not human, and their practices were vile, and they did much evil in the sight of Yahweh, for so was their nature. And so Yahweh told Israel as recorded in scripture: But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them, shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. And it was so.
History in part shows the propagation and movement of these abominations, even the tares planted by Satan himself, as they have lived among the wheat since the days of old. They have set up many civilizations using their technologies and fallen-angel knowledge; they are master builders, they are sorcerers, many of them have unnatural abilities, and they are connected to their father the Devil, even sharing his characteristics and lusts. These tares have infiltrated every aspect of society, and not all of them are giants. Many appear human, except they are hybrid creatures forever altered from Yahweh’s designs in creation and will not be redeemed. Fear them not, for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
These tares seek to take what belongs by inheritance and promise to the children of God. There can be no accord with them, for they are of their father the Devil, and the lusts of their father they will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it. They will absolutely subvert, pollute, destroy, kill, pillage, plunder, and do their worst against anything godly that they set their lusts on. They have no peace, and their nature is utterly corrupt. They have subverted the world, and they will set up their kingdom for one hour as the dragon has his reign on the earth. Yet they seek to re-establish their golden age, but no golden age will they have but harsh judgment, and they shall not escape.
These evil tares have corrupted knowledge, learning, history, religion, science, and on and on they have corrupted. They have propagated fallen angel technology and there is nothing new under the sun. As the times have been fulfilled, they have utterly covered the earth in lies, and the entire world lies in wickedness. By their enlightenment, the Jesuit tares have utterly corrupted society and led mankind into a sea of lies, where the only escape is by repentance and repudiation from all the sins and lies. (For Rome made Islam as well; study to learn.) Their fallen angel knowledge and lies stand against scriptural history and instead offer flimsy fables that blind the minds and hearts of men. Therefore, come out from among them and be ye separate.
The world today is one where many, many people have collective amnesia as a result of Jesuit indoctrination. Many of you have forgotten not only Yahweh’s covenants and ways, but utterly forgotten who you are and who your ancestors truly are. This was done by design through war, lies, and re-population efforts over the years that have scattered so many to the four corners of the earth. Of this they willingly are ignorant that it is impossible to hide anything from Yahweh’s sight; and I, Yeshua HaMashiach, know my own and whom I am calling to salvation.
Some of those who were scattered were orphans and taken from their families either through war or outright kidnapping. These souls grew up on fake history, even being lied to with romanticized notions of a false past, and so the delusion is rooted deeply in the hearts of men, and many are forever blinded by lies that are accepted as truth. But for those who turn to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, you will know the truth

and the truth shall make you free. Your present society is built on the ruins and ashes of the fallen ones’ civilizations of old, and great effort has gone into concealing the truth. That which has been shall be again, and there is nothing new under the sun.
Without my atoning sacrifice and my offer of salvation, you would all be lost. So come to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I will guide you into all truth and I will teach you your true history. I will reconnect you with your true ancestry, for many of you are from the land, though salvation is for all nations. I will teach you in the ways of holiness, and you will live righteously by faith in me, Jesus Christ, and you will live eternally. There is nothing secret that will not come to light, and all will be exposed fully, that the truth may be known by all.
So quit feasting on lies as you bury yourselves in complacency, for the times of complacency are over. The times of revealing are at hand. For behold! As in the days of Noah, so shall it be. Satan has used his tapestry of lies to set the stage for his great end-time deceptions, and most of the world will follow his lies. For the entirety of the devil’s kingdom will be set free from the abyss, and giants will once again live among men, for they are coming to fulfill Yahweh’s wrath.
Satan tells great lies, and these fallen ones will claim they are from other worlds and that they are advanced above mankind by many thousands of years. They will come offering seemingly benevolent knowledge, and they will cloak themselves in false benevolence. But these are of Satan’s kingdom, so do not fall for the deceptions. Do not follow the ways of the world, for the world will wonder after Satan’s kingdom, even saying, who is like unto the beast?
I will hide you away, I will protect you, I will strengthen you, I will guide you step by step, and I will utterly tear down the veil of lies that has covered the world in deceit. I, even Yeshua HaMashiach, will empower and cause you to do many mighty wonders in this time of Jacob’s trouble. And so I tell you these things, so the truth will make you free, and that so you may be free indeed and not fall for their great deception. For its foundations are lies, deceit, and falsehood propagated by the seed of the serpent.
I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes to the father but by me.
I am he who has called you to glory and virtue.
I am he who will rule eternally as Lord of Lords and King of Kings.
I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.
I am he who commands the armies of heaven.
I am he who will appear in the clouds to gather my Church.
I am he who has the keys to death and hell, and I will judge in righteousness.
I am he before whom every knee will bow and every tongue will confess.
I am he who the Great I AM has sent, so hear my words.
Behold! I tell you these things not to give you an exhaustive history lesson but to lead you one step further to the truth. In time, all will come to light and the dragon’s kingdom will be laid bare, for I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have declared it, and I am he whom Yahweh has sent.

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
To the 144,000: For Just Such a Time You Have Been Called and Sealed
JUNE 01, 2024
Stand for me and follow my example, for what says Hebrews regarding my stand for Yahweh? Who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne of God. So in my love for the Father, which is unbreakable, and in my obedience out of love, and in my love for mankind and my desire to sacrifice myself to save you, I endured terrible punishment, agony, and suffering and I did it willingly, with joy in my heart. I knew that by my sacrifice and death, many would be made righteous and alive by the power of my resurrection because Yahweh himself raised me from the dead, for it is impossible that death should hold me. And by that same power, so too will you be raised to newness of life, for I have paid the price by offering my sinless blood as a ransom for all who will believe on my name, and whosoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, who love not their lives to the end!
And so now I ask you, my faithful and chosen, even my kinsmen, to stand for me and do not withdraw yourselves. For I plainly stated in my treatise to the Hebrews: Now the just shall live by faith: but if any withdraw himself, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
Let that sink in, and read it again, and do not withdraw to Torah, for Torah is kept by faith in me; therefore, the just shall live by faith. You are identified with me, and I am he who has justified you in my atoning works and by my sinless blood.
So very many of you struggle with the concept that I took your place in condemnation on the tree for sins that I didn’t commit, and I did so willingly and joyfully to bring salvation to corrupted natural man, that I may redeem them to Yahweh, even your God and your Father, even the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning. For Yahweh changes not; he is the same yesterday, today, and forevermore!
He is the same God on whom your fathers agreed in covenant, even at Mount Sinai when Moses received the law from Yahweh himself. And even though the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good, mankind could never live up to its standards because the law was given to convict sin in the flesh, and you are all born dead in trespasses and sins because sin is in your flesh. Torah was not given for the righteous but for the unrighteous, that sin may appear sin in the flesh. Torah was given as your schoolmaster to bring you to me, even Christ Jesus, the ascended Lord of Lords and King of Kings!
And so I willingly took the consequences of sin on myself, for so was I born to redeem mankind from the curse of the law. For the law was not cursed; yea, let the law stand and every man be accursed who curses the law of Moses, for I did not come to abolish the law, but to establish the law and even exceed the law of Moses. Blasphemy you say?
The witness of the Hebrews stands in mediation between us: For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience

from dead works to serve the living God?
Since you love Moses (as I do), I counsel you to lovingly obey Moses’ instructions; for he said: Yahweh your Elohim will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of you, of your brethren, like unto me; to him, you will listen. So hear the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach! You are purged of sin and all sins you commit by my sinless atoning blood that I offered to Yahweh as a ransom for your lives, and I have even redeemed you from the hand of the enemy. Sin not! And if any man sin, confess your sins to me, for I am he who cleanses you in my atoning blood.
I didn’t atone for your sins and their inherent consequences with a scapegoat, nor did I offer a lamb of the first year; for I am the Lamb of God of the first year, and I am he who offered himself without spot and without blemish, even holy, pure, and consecrated to Yahweh himself (even my Father) for your sins once and for all, even for all time. I atoned for your sins in my sinless blood; therefore, there remains no more sacrifice for sin. And to reject me, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Yahweh’s perfect peace treaty to mankind, is to reject Yahweh and join Satan’s rebellion, because Satan rebels from God’s order from the beginning.
For I told the Hebrews: For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins. So to sin willfully by rejecting my atoning blood, and thereby rejecting the peace treaty sent by Yahweh, is especially grievous, and there is no more sacrifice. For it is written in Hebrews: He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
So I encourage you all to accept my sacrifice and understand that no more sacrifices are necessary and there is but one true Messiah, even me, Yeshua HaMashiach. And it is written of me: But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.
So understand that I have cleansed you in all respects and aspects pertaining to sin and its consequences. You are sanctified in me; you are justified in me; you are made the righteousness of God in me; and I have fully redeemed you to myself, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach, whom Yahweh has sent as your Messiah. And so understand that there are no more Levitical High Priests, and the Priesthood of Aaron has come and gone, for it was a shadow of things to come. For I am your high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
Because the law made nothing perfect: but was an introduction of a better hope, by which hope we draw near to Yahweh. And again: Such an High Priest it became us to have which is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than heaven. And again: For the law makes men priests, which have infirmity: but the word of the oath that came since the law, makes the son priest, which is perfect forevermore. Have you not read what scripture states concerning me? Yahweh swore and will not repent: You are a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
Understand that there is nothing lacking in my sacrifice, and you are secure in me, Christ Jesus. Torah is kept by faith in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and it is impossible for you to violate any of the laws of God by walking in me, Christ Jesus. For you walk in the law of the Spirit of life, and I have made you free from the law of sin and death. So have faith in me, for the just shall live by faith. I have many mighty works that I

have called you to, and you will help bring salvation to many. There is great hope and reward laid up for you in the heavens for your stand and your faithfulness.
For I send you forth, sealed in your foreheads with the seal of Yahweh himself, into a world that will utterly hate you, and no marvel, for the world utterly hated me first, and the servant is not above his master. You are my witnesses and prophets and my healers and my providers. I send you into the darkest darkness ever to overshadow Yahweh’s creation. For such a time as this you have been called, chosen, and sealed, and these times will be the most perverse and evil the world has ever seen, even worse than the days of Noah. Into their midst I send you, and I tell you to fear not! Fear not their threats; fear not what man can do to you; fear not their faces; fear not the spirits that empower them; fear not the beast and false prophet; and fear not Satan himself: Even that great dragon. For you will trample on every aspect of Satan’s kingdom, and nothing shall by any means stop you if you stay faithful to my voice and let me direct you step by step. For of a truth, you are fellow workers with me in this time of Jacob’s trouble, and I have empowered you.
You are mighty and powerful, and I send you forth in meekness and humility. I send you forth to keep the law by your faith in me, and so love Yahweh with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. Who is your neighbor? All those in need of your help to whom I am sending you, and I am not restraining you by national boundary. Go forth and shepherd my flock, for I am the Chief Shepherd who has your reward in my hand for faithfulness. Go tend to my flock, tend to their wounds, feed them, heal them, lead them, and above all bring them to me; for of yourselves you are nothing, but in me, you are my powerful, mighty men of God. Teach them to call on my name till the end, for whosoever does will be saved.
Keep your eyes on the prize and the joy that is set before you, and press forward toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. For your reward will be great, and you will be astounded at what is laid up for you in the heavens. And my reward is not temporal but eternal, and your rewards will not perish but serve as an everlasting inheritance in fulfillment of the promises Yahweh made to the fathers; every yod or a thorn of a yod will be fulfilled. You will not realize the magnitude of your labors until that day of reward, but Scripture is clear as to the fruit of your labors.
For John the Revelator faithfully wrote what I showed him: After these things I beheld, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and kindred, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with long white robes, and palms in their hands. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation comes of our God, that sits upon the throne, and of the Lamb. For a great multitude will you help save and minister, and great will be your rewards of faithfulness.
And you will follow me wherever I go, and you are the first fruits bought from men, and you will sing a new song before the throne that only you can learn. You will also reign with me in my Kingdom a thousand years and will ever be with me in eternity. For yours is an eternal joy, for you will be with me in my Kingdom on earth as I rule the earth in righteousness from the throne of David, and my Kingdom has no end. And no evil thing will enter, and there will be no more trouble, and mine is a kingdom of righteousness where the lamb and the lion will lie down together in peace. And at the end of my thousandyear reign, Satan will be loosed a little season to gather his final attack, and fire will come down from Yahweh and utterly destroy them. Satan will be cast into the lake of fire, never to rise again, and Yahweh will create a new heaven and a new earth, and he will make his dwelling amongst men, and so you will

To the 144,000 and the Tribulation Saints of Jacob’s Trouble
MAY 31, 2024
To the 144,000 and the tribulation saints of Jacob’s trouble: Behold! I tell you many things before they happen so that the wise man among you who hears my voice may become yet wiser still, and that you may know the surety of my words. For Satan will attempt to cover the departing of the faithful in my Church (for I will snatch them away in their departure from the earth into the heavens) with war and a fake appearing of so-called aliens that are nothing more than fallen ones revealing themselves to the earth in iniquity after iniquity fully rooted in their lies. For they are deception.
They have lied about the so-called universe; for there is no ever-expanding universe of random nothingness, but above the earth is the heaven of the heavens, even the (highest heaven) where Yahweh the most high God abides on his throne, and yet he will make his abode with men. Yet he is everywhere present and is all in all within the Body of Christ. On earth resides his pearl of great price, even those who were chosen in eternities past in the heart of Yahweh himself. And so the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof; for I, Jesus the Nazarene, have purchased the earth in my own redeeming blood.
Learn your true cosmology (study to learn) and believe the description and words in Holy Scripture regarding the creation, for it is as Yahweh has described in Scripture, and it is impossible for Yahweh to lie. If, when I tell you earthly things, you believe not, how should you believe if I shall tell you of heavenly things? No, there are no aliens in the sense their lies describe, but fallen angels, rebellious ones, even Satan and his kingdom who have lied and deceived the earth that all may be damned who have pleasure in unrighteousness.
They have woven many cleverly devised fables into a tapestry of lies, and they have controlled both sides of their narratives since the beginning as they pushed forth their agendas. For they control the thesis and they control the antithesis, and they synthesize their evil works step by step, and their deception is great! But the light of Holy Scripture exposes the treachery, and yet man rejects God’s help until judgment is pronounced and calamity hits. Then mankind seeks to repent when it is too late after judgment is passed, and those who live in such manner will not escape their judgment. For whatever is declared by Yahweh can no one change!
Many will succumb to the coming delusions that will arise out of world war and the calamity that is about to overtake the earth. For they will present themselves to mankind as benevolent creatures who have come from advanced worlds to share their benevolent knowledge. But it is just the knowledge of good and evil repackaged to suit their ends. They will have superior technologies and will appear well advanced, far beyond natural man. But their only advancements are in evil, and they are not of this earth but created by Yahweh in the beginning of creation in the heavens. They were present when Yahweh created the earth. The Father in his foreknowledge knew they would betray and so kept his precious heart’s mystery concealed from those he knew would bring evil destruction to his creation.
I am still calling natural man to righteousness, but natural man instead prefers sickness, sin, and darkness; and so I will give mankind what he so passionately desires. Since natural man practices evil and loves

darkness, I will give him unrestrained darkness.
Because at present, natural man arrogantly stands in my grace using mercy as a reason to lay sin upon sin, instead of accepting Yahweh’s peace treaty, even me, Yeshua HaMashiach, who gave my sinless blood in obedience to Yahweh for payment for all the sins of mankind for all time. Make no mistake: I am the true Messiah, and all else are cheap imitations of no value.
Satan rebelled shortly after the start of creation and polluted the Father’s creation in a shameless, evil, hostile, and destructive manner; but it was done in great subtlety and with lying signs and wonders, even advanced technologies that dazzle the senses. And in return they demand worship and strict obedience to their ways, yet their ways always bring mankind’s death and destruction, for so they are designed.
There is nothing new under the sun, my children. The so-called gods of ancient history and their abominable offspring referred to as demigods will return, and as in the days of Noah, so shall it be. For they are released from their bonds and torment that they may receive their full judgment, and I will repay, saith the Lord Jesus Christ, and Yahweh will recompense them to the uttermost.
Satan and his fallen ones refused to bow the knee to Yahweh’s order and instead tried to steal the earth from mankind through great deception. Satan has even tried to steal my inheritance from the Father of Lights! But no one is able to pluck not the least of you from my hands, and no one can strip my inheritance; for it is given of Yahweh himself, and whoever refuses to bow the knee to me, Jesus Christ, rebels against Yahweh’s order, joining the fallen ones forevermore.
So I tell you, do not believe the lies of Copernicus, who was a Jesuit and Freemason who served Satan. He simply retaught the words of ancient Greek pagan philosophers. And so your accepted cosmology was imagined by sun worshipers and pagans based on Satan’s lies, even the blasphemous Jesuits who have corrupted your educational systems with learning against learning, with the full intent that their fake universe may be etched into the minds of men through lies packaged as education. Instead, mindless indoctrination has occurred, and the world as it is truly is not understood by those who live on the earth.
Now the stage is set for very strong delusion, and the lies are already built, for its foundations are iniquities and great deception. These deceptions are rooted in your Jesuit educations. For the entire world is deceived by their falsehoods; even the very elect would be deceived if possible. And so the trap is ready to spring, and the only thing holding it back is the restrainer, which will be removed so very suddenly and soon. Then great war will break across the earth as my faithful are gathered to me in the heavens. Then from the ashes will rise the beast and the false prophet, who will be central in the coming deception.
So believe not their lies, my mighty ones, for you are a peculiar people and I have called and sealed you with the seal of the Living God, that God’s wrath may not touch you. I will send you forth as my mighty ones. You will be my many voices crying in the wilderness wherever you are sent, and I am sending you to gather my remaining lost sheep.
For a great multitude will come out of Jacob’s trouble, and you will do mighty exploits and command the impossible, for I will grant many mighty signs, miracles, and wonders to be done by your hands. You will do the mighty miracles of old recorded in Holy Scripture, even in the power of Elijah, except greater and more powerful works will you do than is recorded of him of old.
For Scripture states that he that believes on me, Yeshua HaMashiach, shall not only do the works I did on

the earth in my ministry to Judea as the lamb of God, but mightier works than even I did will you do, for I will grant mighty signs, miracles, and wonders at your hands as you command the impossible by faith in me. So look to me always. And keep your eyes on me, for I will lead you step by step. Your walk will be one of wisdom, and you will have the tongue of the wise, and I will be your strength and salvation, for in me, Christ Jesus, does all fullness dwell.
And so I counsel you all that so very soon money will become worthless, and the only accepted currency will require the mark to have access to the world’s goods. Take not the mark, for it would be better to die in this life (loving not your lives till the end) than to take the mark and be cast to the eternal lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, for their times have come; only join them not. For they will promise seemingly great and precious promises, but their words are false, and venom is in their words, and their promises are false and full of all manner of unclean things. They will never be able to deliver their promises, for their judgment comes; they have no peace, and peace shall be utterly taken from the earth.
Mankind’s evil will be totally unrestrained; and for many, once the restrainer is removed, they will forevermore give themselves over to insanity and evil. Except he who lives by the sword must be killed by the sword, and they will surely fall to the left and to the right in great number, but it will not come to you as you walk for me; only love not your lives till the end and follow my example of selfless service and sacrifice. For great reward will be yours for obedience and faithfulness.
So mankind’s passions and evil will be completely unrestrained, and the Devil and his angels will be completely unrestrained, and all their evil abominations shall be completely unrestrained, and they will come as the helpers of old. Their deception runs deep and has deep roots that are soon to be utterly plucked up. They are no gods, and they are no advanced benevolent ones, but deceivers, and they have polluted themselves in all manner of ways. And so they will be totally unrestrained, and the fullness of Satan’s kingdom will be released from the abyss, for it will be opened.
This will be done to show natural man what he has chosen and give a final chance at repentance; for evil will be concealed and restrained no longer, and every secret will come to light. Even the lies of their great deception and strong delusions will be laid bare for all to see, for Yahweh has declared it in Holy Scripture, and what Yahweh declares can no one alter.
And so a final separation will occur, and many of the complacent whom I love will be left to the trials and testing to come, even so that they may be saved. For there is no more time, and my grace and mercy will no longer be given in the same manner, and there is no more time for lukewarm ways. Everyone will have to make a choice; and for the fearful and unbelieving they will have chosen Satan and his kingdom when they could have chosen me, even Jesus Christ, the son of God who has come in the flesh and have given myself as the perfect Passover for all the sins of mankind once and for all. Many will still yet stubbornly refuse my hand of help in time of great need, for my help is an eternal and everlasting help of great reward, mercy, grace, and love.
Yet, most of the world will believe the lies and will wonder after the beast, saying, who is like the beast? They will readily allow themselves to be bitten of the serpent bite of which the venom can never be remedied, for it is permanent. For man to chose evil in the times of choosing will be a permanent choice, and those who make that choice will stand in great judgment.

Those who willingly choose evil will give account for every evil thought, every evil word, and every evil deed that they have evilly committed on the earth, for the books will be opened and there will be no mercy. And no man will be able stand in his own righteousness, for man has no righteousness of his own; for the serpent corrupted them from the beginning, and his days of corruption are coming to an end. Thus did Yahweh send me, his only begotten son, as a peace treaty to natural man, and natural man has rejected everlasting peace because natural man loves evil.
Great judgment is about to be unleashed on Satan’s kingdom. This judgment will become worse and worse, and events executed in judgment will become worse and worse. Woe will be added to woe and torment will be added to torment for all who refuse to repent of their evil deeds. For many will not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: Neither will they repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
For the fallen ones are no gods, but lying impostors, pretenders, actors, and manipulators. They bring only death and destruction to those who follow, and all who are deceived will be utterly disappointed, for their expectations will evaporate in that great lake of fire where there is no hope. And I, Christ Jesus, will utterly dismantle Satan’s kingdom in great judgment, for great judgment will be unleashed on them all, and I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.
And so each seal will add judgment on top of judgment, and each trumpet will add judgment on top of judgment, each woe will add woe on top of woe, and with each vial comes the full wrath of God, even wrath on top of wrath. Satan’s kingdom will suffer greatly, and his kingdom will be completely annihilated and utterly destroyed.
For they will gather themselves and array themselves against the coming of the Lord, for I will surely come. From the start of Jacob’s trouble, there will be seven days of years, for Daniel’s seventieth week will be fulfilled for the destruction of unrighteousness and for the salvation of Israel. For I will purge Israel from the evil that has seized the land.
For neither Yahweh nor I myself, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent nor commissioned their rulers, for they rule in unrighteousness and their genocides are abominable, and my people pay the price of their wars. And yet so many of my Church believe their Zionist lies, and so understand that I am no Zionist, for they are Jewish supremacists, and they are tares, Satan’s very seed; and I will root them out of the land, for they have laid claim to my inheritance, and I am coming to take what is mine. Because I, Yeshua HaMashiach, even I, hold the deed to the earth; for I purchased it in my own sinless blood, and I have the keys to death and hell. And I have paid for the sins of mankind, and whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
So the earth is mine and the fullness thereof, and I will cleanse the land of their evil, and the synagogue of Satan will be utterly destroyed, and so I will bring the new testament to earth and will rule in righteousness. For as the earth gets darker and more evil by the second, my second coming is closer by the second.
Have great hope for my coming; for I will come and will break forth from the skies with the armies of heaven, even an army like no other, for an army such as mine has never been, an unconquerable army composed of those who live life eternal and cannot be killed nor conquered. For I am empowered by Yahweh for such a purpose, and I will have empowered and rewarded them for their faithfulness and love

for me and my name, even Jesus the Christ! For whoever loves and serves Yeshua HaMashiach also loves and serves Yahweh, for there is no higher than the great everlasting God of Israel! Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father; and I am Jesus Christ the only begotten of the Father who offered himself for the sins of all, and I am forever high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
And I will utterly defeat the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. For the beast and false prophet will be cast alive into that burning lake that burns the hottest flames of blue that can never be quenched and of which there will not be even a second of rest. But all of their evil deeds will be returned to them eternally. All the suffering they have caused will be recompensed eternally, for Yahweh will repay every evil deed to the uttermost farthing into their own evil bosoms, and they will pay eternally for their crimes.
And so Satan will be bound in the abyss for a thousand years, for so has been declared by Yahweh. I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will rule the earth in righteousness for a day. For with Yahweh a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day. And I will rule from the throne of David, and in Israel will my rule abide in fulfillment of the promises made by Yahweh to the Fathers, and my day is nearly here.
But first judgment must come on the earth and the earth will be purged of every evil thing. For no evil thing will be allowed into my kingdom, where will be peace and safety as promised by Yahweh himself. And the lion shall lie down with the lamb. I, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach, declare the words before they happen, that you may know that the God of Israel has come to gather his lost sheep of the house of Israel to me, the Chief Shepherd, and I will smite the nations with a rod of iron, and I will utterly subdue the Father’s creation in righteousness and true holiness. There is time no more.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, the true Messiah to my people Israel.
I am he that will rule the earth in righteousness from the Throne of David.
I am he who will appear in the clouds with the armies of heaven, for I will command them.
I am he who will gather my remnant as a great multitude from the coming tribulation.
I am he who tests the hearts of men, and I will separate the sheep from the goats.
I am the Lord of harvest, and the times of harvest have come.
I am the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and who can stand?
Behold the day of the Lord is about to break across the earth in calamity and judgment. For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
To the 144,000: Hear My Words and Wisdom!
MAY 25, 2024
Hear my words and incline your ear to my wisdom, for I, the Lord Jesus Christ, will speak with you if you will hear my words. For I will seal my 144,000; have you not read? And I saw another Angel ascending from the East, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And so I will send those whom I will seal, and you shall do mighty works for me, and you will walk in great power. But this will not be as in the age of grace, where preachers in pulpits taught from the holy writings. (Some spoke falsely and some did mighty works for me in their churches.) The church age is coming to a close, and my age of grace is nearly completed, and so the times of testing will begin, even Jacob’s trouble.
And so I will send you to tend to my flock that will be further scattered and tested by calamity after calamity. For the days will be evil, and you will shine as lights and stand as pillars among the scattered. And so I send you to love and care for your neighbor. For you who are faithful to my calling will live the law I have given, not the law of Moses. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have fulfilled the law of Moses, and Torah is kept by faith in me, for the just shall live by faith.
And so it shall be: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. For in so doing these things you will surely save your soul from destruction as well as those to whom I send you. These are not the times of long lives and prosperity, for those days have passed from the earth until I come to rule the earth in righteousness. He who loves not his life until the end shall be saved and live eternally.
You are alive in times of war, and great wrath, and great revelation of all things. For the great eternal God, even Yahweh, will conceal himself no longer from the earth; for he will break forth from his abode, and he is sending me, even Yeshua HaMashiach, to fulfill his wrath and fulfill his promises he made to the Fathers. But first, judgment will fall, and great wrath will fall on the world, and you will no longer be able to participate in their society. For participation in their society that will rise from the ashes will require everyone to receive their mark. If you join them, you will share in their eternal damnation in that great lake of fire, and that lake was prepared by God for the Devil and his angels, so join them not.
You will find no peace in their rising world but only unrestrained evil, for I will have removed the restrainer. And if you are not part of their hive mind, then you will have no part with them, for they will kill all who dissent. For the mark will forever alter those who accept by altering their very DNA, for mankind was made in the image of Yahweh, though Satan seeks to blasphemously alter that image irrevocably through his pharmaceuticals which are peddled in great lies. They will promise you long life, peace, and prosperity, but those lies are simply bait. For once the mark is taken, nothing will undo the damage, for Yahweh has so declared!
For the servant is not greater than his master, and I am calling you to works where I will lead you step by step, and as in the days of Noah, so shall it be. And so I, Yeshua HaMashiach, fulfilled my purpose as the

lamb of God, for I offered my sinless blood to Yahweh of my own free will choice and on account of the perfect love that burns in my heart.
And so for the joy that was set before me, I endured great trouble, torment, and anguish, (even unjustly) because I took all the consequences of all the sins of mankind onto myself. And I paid for every sin, fully, and I did it willingly. So look unto me, Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith, who for the joy that was set before me, endured the cross, and despised the shame, and am set at the right hand of the throne of God. So follow my example to great victory, for even in the wilderness I will make your path plain.
So understand, there will be no peace, and I send you to minister in a time of great war and trouble. For the dragon will make war on the saints and will overcome them, for so has he been empowered to accomplish. And those who call on the name of the Lord will be saved, for those who love not their lives until the end will find their lives eternally in me, Christ Jesus. For I have atoned for the sins of mankind in my sinless blood, and I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, who has offered my sinless blood to Yahweh once and for all. Therefore, do not return to the old ways, nor their traditions, nor their Talmud, nor the Torah; for Torah is kept fully by faith in me, Jesus Christ.
And so through great troubles, great pains, great struggles, shall my holy ones shine, and great will be their reward, for great is my reward. For what says the promise: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
And so I will send those whom I have called. I am calling you to love God with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength, and am sending you to love your neighbor as yourself. For survival will come from life-giving words my Father has given for obedience by all. And so love your neighbor, care for one another, help and sustain one another; for my people will be scattered. They will gather in communities in the wilderness, and though the wilderness will not be safe, I will provide refuge for my people and will provide sustenance for their needs.
And so I will send those whom I have called. I am sending you to command the impossible as you walk in love and great power, even the power I will clothe you with. For you will walk for me step by step many times in obedience, as you rely on me, Christ Jesus, who will lead you by my spirit; and the anointing you have will cause you to walk victoriously. But it will come to pass as scripture says: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.
Step by step will you walk, and I will lead you in such manner. For I am your refuge and fortress, even your true Messiah in whom you will trust. And though a thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand: but it shall not come near you. For you are sealed to fulfill my purposes, and great reward and promise I have given you to sustain and strengthen you, for I am sending you in the works my Father has ordained of me, and so I send you as my ministers and prophets.
So as you go to command the impossible, know that you will command much by the spirit born within you.

So command the mountains to be removed and cast into the sea, as you have faith in Yahweh. So command the spirits to depart as you speak mighty words with great faith in Yahweh. So command all sickness and pestilence to depart as you speak words that must be obeyed (even by all things) as you speak words of great power with great faith in Yahweh. For by Yahweh’s own plans and purposes have I been sent, and in those plans and purposes I am sending you, and you will do mighty works for me. For Yahweh is all in all by my spirit, with which I will seal the chosen.
For in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, all fullness dwells, for the Father has given me all things in heaven and earth, so I may fulfill all. And so Yahweh is all in all, and you have access to the Father and to his Son, for thus Moses taught: The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken. I am that prophet of whom Moses has spoken (even raised up from the tribe of Judah), and I am so much more; for the Father has determined that I, Yeshua HaMashiach, should have all preeminence, and in me all fullness should dwell. I am that prophet of whom Moses has spoken, even raised from the dead for such a purpose.
And so I will provide for you and for those to whom I will send you. For you will be a beacon of light, even hidden in plain sight in a dark and unstable world. You will preach all things pertaining to me, your Lord and savior, for I am the lamb of God, even the perfect Passover. There is salvation in no other name except mine, even Jesus Christ the Righteous.
Some of you I will take from place to place, and you will be my spokesman, prophets, and ministers. You will need to test the spirits of those you encounter and walk in great wisdom; for the world you have known will be replaced with a lawless world of many wastelands, and some of you will be sent to minster to those in the wastelands, and you will understand my instructions, and you will do great exploits.
And so understand that after the war and destruction that is to occur after I gather my faithful (and remove the restrainer), there will be much chaos and destruction. People will run to and fro, and many will perish in faithless unbelief, and they will hunt and capture and kill many. And for many, the first voice they will hear will not be mine, though that voice will offer false salvation. No, even the beast who will rise in great power from the dragon will falsely call many to their eternal end of which there is no hope.
They will all pretend, for they are great pretenders, and they will pretend that they are the true Messiah, and their followers will claim to represent the true Messiah and the true God; but I have not sent them, so do not follow their false beacons of hope. For they will offer entrance into their new society to build their new world; but to enter, one must take the mark. And to those who take the mark, entrance will be granted into the fiery flames of blue in that great lake of fire burning with brimstone. For all who take the mark will have their part in the fires that are unquenchable and will have exchanged eternal life for a morsel of bread in the ways of Esau.
You will need to ignore all voices but mine and depart from all those who reject me. It will take great wisdom, skill, and cunning to survive, and I will give you the tongue of the wise that you may know how to answer every man. For I will make plain my voice to you, though it is but a still, small voice. You will know my voice, for I will confirm my voice to you many times over, so be not faithless but have great faith in my words of promise.
I will teach you all things, and you will know how to do the works I am sending you to accomplish. My

voice is a perfect voice, even the voice of one crying in the wilderness, and I am speaking through the voice of one who cries in the wilderness; for so have they been sent, even my prophets and ministers who have gone ahead to make your paths straight and your ways plain. I have ordained many mighty works for you, and you will do mightily.
Therefore, know my tribes, kinsman, and children of promise: the harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest. Go your ways: Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. For I am the Lord of Harvest, and though the laborers have always been few, there is great reward and eternal profit and glory for the work you will do. For you will reap much reward and fruit in me; only faint not at your tribulations and troubles. This is the final separation, and all who are ordained to eternal life from before the foundations of the World will be found, and they will never be lost, for nobody is able to pluck them from my hand.
And so your works will follow into eternity, and in your many exploits you will glorify Yahweh, who has sent me, Yeshua HaMashiach, as your true Messiah. And by your many mighty accomplishments and many salted words of truth that you will speak, you will announce my soon return and go in the works of John the Baptist to prepare for the coming of the Lord: so announce my return, for I will surely fulfill my words of promise. For verily at the end of Jacob’s trouble, even at the end of the last week of years, even Daniel’s seventieth week, I will return with the armies in heaven to establish my Kingdom on Earth, even the Kingdom of God; and my thousand year reign will commence, even a reign of righteousness, holiness, and peace as the Lion will lie down with the Lamb!
I am calling you to works where I will lead you step by step.
I am calling you to love God with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself.
I am sending you to command the impossible as you walk in great love and great power.
I am your refuge and fortress, even your true Messiah in whom you trust.
I am sending you in the works my Father has ordained for me, and so I ordain you as my ministers and prophets.
I am sending you, and you will do mighty works for me.
I am that prophet of whom Moses has spoken, even raised up from Judah for such a purpose.
I am so much more, for in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, all fullness dwells.
I am the lamb of God, even the perfect Passover.

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
Hear My Words and Understand the Times in Which You Live!
MAY 23, 2024
Hear my Words, my people, even all whom I am calling, and understand the times in which you live. For the world you now know will cease to exist, and in its place many wastelands will remain, even the ashes and ruins of Mystery Babylon, for war has come. For as I snatch my Bride into the heavens, great calamity will engulf Mystery Babylon, and she shall be destroyed in one hour, and in one hour shall she be destroyed, and nothing can change her fate, for Yahweh has so declared.
For you, Secret Babylon, you have rejected my voice and set me, Jesus Christ the Righteous, aside for the pleasures of sin. For even the great warnings given over your nation in the heavens served only to provide entertainment for your faithless hearts and lustful eyes, and to you it was just another day as you lived deliciously in your sins that are leading you to your destruction. You should have repented!
For you have become a nation of idolaters, a nation of warmongers, a nation who feasts on lies and who loves their delusions, a nation who has filled the earth with your abominations; and the nations drink of your golden cup which is full of abominations and filthiness of your fornication.
Therefore, I am against you, and your destruction is here and has already begun, for you have ignored the call of Yahweh given through me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I would have saved you. And I have wept over your hard-hearted ways, but you still will not turn from evil; so I have turned away from you, and the times of the Gentiles are about to be brought to full completion as I catch away the faithful in my Church at the trumpet’s call.
But you are a nation bound in chains, and you will utterly be destroyed, and you will never rise again. As my Bride is taken, the world will wonder in great astonishment at what they witnessed, for this event will not happen in secret, but openly, that all the world may know that there is a God in heaven and that he has sent me, Christ Jesus, for the gold, silver, and precious stones of the earth. For the Father’s greatest treasures, even the pearls of great price, will be taken away from the judgment and destruction to come.
For my Bride is saved from wrath on account of my sacrifice, and I will rescue the faithful and those found faithful in Christ at the time of my appearing and all who have died faithful in Christ, even sealed by me, Christ Jesus, for I have been made a life-giving spirit. And I will resurrect the dead in Christ, and those which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet me in the clouds. So understand that this event is to reward the faithful and to consummate the marriage of the Bridegroom to my Bride, for we will be forever joined in covenant and never will they depart from me. And I am he who will make them kings and priests before my Father.
And so they will leave the earth, and so the world will see, and many will wonder in great astonishment. For in part, the reason for this event is to engender repentance among those who are left behind, even those who refused my call during the age of grace, and also many who have not heard enough to believe who will be saved during Jacob’s trouble, especially those of the land of promise.

For I am calling you, oh, Israel: are you ready to hear the voice of your true Messiah, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? For the voice of your true Messiah is calling, and I am he who will rule from the throne of David in the holy city, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach; only ignore not the words of my call! And so the age of grace, even the times of refreshing, are now closing out in finality. And so that finality will fully arrive when I gather the faithful of my Church to me in the clouds and when their departing shakes the entire world.
It will literally shake the earth, and great shaking will consume Secret Babylon, and she will be rent up the middle as my saints depart. She will be utterly burned with fire from the sky as the missiles will fall. Her skirts will be covered with waters from the east and from the west! For a mighty angel will take up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. For thus is it written and thus shall it be done!
For great is her judgment, and judgment has begun at the house of God. Her apostate churches will be destroyed, for I have judged them all that are not of me, even all the fake churches who speak great lies in hypocrisy. Mystery Babylon, oh, that you had turned to me, Jesus Christ, from your evil ways, for I would have saved you, and neither me nor Yahweh have any pleasure in the judgments that are about to be unleashed.
But nevertheless, judgments will fall as pronounced, and that judgment will be severe and everlasting. For I had turned to the Gentiles for a season, and now I will turn away from the Gentiles and will turn to the flock of which I arose, even Israel. Though whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved, whether Judean or Gentile, for salvation is not bound by international borders.
Oh, Secret Babylon, your bridges will fall; your roads will be overturned, broken, and unpassable; your supply chains are already crumbling and will soon be desolate. No provisions will be delivered to you, for nobody will come to your aid, and you will be alone in your hour of desolation, oh, great harlot. You will have no happiness, and those who survive will find themselves fighting just to have a drink of water. Starvation will overtake the land. And great pestilence will overtake you, and even the animals will attack, for the times are here.
The red armies that your treasonous government allowed into your borders will slay every man, woman, and child who does not fit their purposes. For they will kill and enslave all they find. They are the armies of the beast that have been gathered from the four corners of the earth for this purpose, and the concealed beast and concealed false prophet have gathered them.
They have no sympathy, no mercy, no grace, no remorse, and they utterly hate the inhabitants of Mystery Babylon for the awful sins your leaders have perpetrated on their lands. And all the while so many of you cheered on your unjust wars as you watched in amusement on your televisions, as you took great pleasure in the sins of your leaders.
You have given your consent to your leaders whose sins you endorsed by vote, and so you will share in their judgment, for you have made yourselves worthy of a double portion of judgment, and it will overtake you suddenly.
And so my Bride will appear at my judgment seat, and some will suffer loss, some will carry away great reward, and all will receive fully of the down payment they have already received: For I will give them new, sinless bodies that will never corrupt! And so the seals will be loosed, for though tribulation and anguish

have abounded on the earth for many years now, they are not the wrath of God nor the wrath of the lamb.
So many of you foolishly think you have to endure the wrath of God, arrogantly thinking you are able to bear what is coming. Understand that I have saved my Church from wrath, for I came to my own and to the Gentiles during the age of grace as a peace treaty, offering peace and reconciliation to the Father of Lights, even El Shaddai! And those whom I have saved have by their free will accepted my unmerited favor, so follow their example!
And I will seal my 144,000 from the following tribes, even 12,000 from each of the following: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Nephthali, Manasses, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. So hear my voice!
And you will do many mighty works for me, and you will lead many to salvation out of a dying and violent world. For Satan already has prepared a great deception and will do his best to lie, cover, and hide the great gathering in the clouds that is about to happen. His lies are already rooted in your minds and hearts through your Jesuit educations that deny my Father and are brought to you by the fallen ones. They have made spurious all things, even leading many of you to believe that above the earth is an endless void of planets and other life, and many will be so naive as to swallow these lies. Even those whose names have never been entered into the Book of Life, for they will accept their mark.
Know, my people, and hear my warning. There is no life on other planets! Study to learn, for planets are wandering stars ordained to declare the handiwork of Yahweh in the expanse under the firmament. These will not be aliens from other falsely rotating worlds; however, they are not of the earth, for they are fallen angels who are of the heavens, and many abominations have they made for themselves. Believe them not!
So from the ashes of the horseman and out of great destruction will the beast and false prophet arise, for the mystery of iniquity is already at work. For Mystery Babylon is given into their hands and the confederation that is forming, even the ten horns will destroy her, for they are ten kings who give their all to the dragon, beast, and false prophet. For once the restrainer is removed, they will fully rise according to Scripture; for out of chaos rises their new order, even the order of the Dragon, for he is their power and authority, for so has been given him in a limited way for a very short time.
The dragon has great wrath and will move in the spirit of Haman to make all things of Christ illegal, and anyone who is associated with my name, even Jesus Christ, will be hunted and killed. And those who love not their lives to the end will be saved and have great reward. So keep your mind and heart on the joy set before you, for in such manner I secured your salvation in the agonizing torment that was yours, except I willingly took your punishment and paid fully for the sins of mankind once and for all, even for all time.
The beast will move swiftly, for he will continue for 42 months speaking great blasphemous things. He will make war with the saints, and it is given to overcome them. He will behead many. He will do many lying signs and wonders, and out of the ashes will arise his new order. And the false prophet will point to him and praise him and cause all to worship his image, for these things are recorded plainly in Scripture. And so the beast will purge the earth of anything good, holy, and precious. Yet, I will hide my faithful, and many miracles will they do, and many will be saved.
But the false prophet, even the beast from the earth, will cause all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or

sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. So understand that to participate in their new false society of lies will require the mark, and all who take the mark never have forgiveness. And they will have their part in that great lake which burns with fire and brimstone forever and ever, and so will the smoke of their torment rise.
My two witnesses will rise, and they shall prophesy clothed in sackcloth! These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. And none will be able to stand against them, for they will prophesy for 42 months. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeded out of their mouth, and devoured their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And they will leave their bodies in the streets for three and a half days, and the entire world will rejoice, and then they will be resurrected and caught away to the heavens.
The false prophet has already ingratiated himself to those in the land to think he is their Messiah and king. He is a fake temple builder and comes from the tribe of Dan, and he is no Cyrus. He will give all support to the first beast who rises out of the sea. For the first beast will brutally enforce Noahide on the nations in great lawlessness, and the false prophet will reign in the throne that is not his, for it is mine, even Yeshua HaMashiach’s. And so the temple will be built, and the false prophet will do many lying signs and wonders, for he is empowered the same as the first beast, and so the two will work with one mind and one purpose, even with the mind and purposes of that great lying dragon, but he is worthless and toothless, so fear him not!
For he knows that I am coming to destroy his kingdom, for he is no king but an utterly defeated enemy, who has absolutely no hope. So fear him not and stay single-minded on me. For behold, I tell you these things before they happen that you may have faith in me and have faith in my Father who has sent me, even Yahweh the great eternal God, and even me his son, Yeshua HaMashiach, who will fulfill the promises made to the fathers.
And so at the end of the first 42 months the abomination of desolation will take place at the hand of the false prophet, even the beast to rise from the earth. During the second 42 months, even during that time will the greatest tribulation ever occur and the abomination of desolation, and he will declare himself God! Many will be crushed and many shall perish, but those who are obedient to my voice will be taken to a place in the wilderness where they will be hidden away and kept safe for a season, as these will be the most brutal times, and these times of trials and testing will be the most severe. Then you will see the heavens opened, and you will see me, Jesus Christ, lead out from the heavens that great and mighty heavenly host, and it will be an army like no other, ever! For my Bride will be with me. And I will crush the beast and the false prophet and all their armies and all their abominations that they have abominably made, and so will they be destroyed even by the brightness of my coming and by that sharp double-edged sword proceeding from my mouth, and they shall not stand but will be utterly destroyed. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into that burning lake of fire and brimstone, and never will they be released from their torment, for they have made themselves worthy.

And then will the resurrection of the just occur, when the saints of old and the tribulation saints will be raised from the dead to newness of life, and they will die no more, and I will bestow great reward on them, of such that has not even entered into the hearts of men at this time. For I am a merciful Lord and a merciful King, and I am the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
And so my thousand-year rule on earth will begin, and righteousness will rule on earth, and I will rule the nations with a rod of iron, and the earth will abound with the ways of Yahweh. For I am coming with a multitude of kings and priests, and they will rule in my throne, and they will rule in righteousness. And the lion will lie down with the lamb.
I am calling you to understand the times in which you live.
I am a life-giving spirit, for so have I been made.
I am he who will make them kings and priests before my Father.
I am calling you, oh Israel.
I am coming to destroy Satan’s kingdom, for he is no king.
I am a merciful Lord and a merciful King.

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
To the 144,000: Hear My Call!
MAY 20, 2024
Oh hear, Oh hear, my twelve tribes, the voice of your Messiah, Lord, King and High priest, even me, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Son of Man whom Yahweh raised from the dead. For:
I am your true Messiah, who is descended from the throne of David, and it is from his throne that I will rule the Land of Promise for Yahweh, the eternal God, for so he promised your Fathers. And so understand that I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and no king or prophet has been given from Dan, from where the false prophet comes.
I am your Lord, for Yahweh has made me Lord of Lords, and I have purchased you with my own blood as your perfect Passover, even given for the sins of Gentile and Judean alike, that you both may be one new man in me, even Christ Jesus. For Yahweh has given me a name above every name and caused me to share in His throne on account of my obedience. And so my Lordship is given as a beacon of salvation, for I have been made a life-giving spirit, and only Yahweh is greater than I, for He is the eternal God.
I am your King, for Yahweh has made me King of Kings, and I will rule the earth in righteousness. And behold! I bring my Bride, who will rule with me, for I have made them kings and priests before the eternal Yahweh, of which there is none like Him. For in my promised coming millennial reign, I will be the highest authority, and I will send my kings and priests to rule in their inheritance in me; for I have created them newly in me, even taken from Judean and Gentile alike and made into one new man, even re-created in perfection. I am one in unity and purpose with my Father, Yahweh, and in His throne He is greater than I.
I am your high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and I offered my own atoning blood in sacrifice when I gave myself as your perfect and complete Passover. For the Hebrews lend their witness when I had the Apostle Paul address them on my behalf (he was from Benjamin): How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And so my sacrifice of myself is once and for all and forever, and there is no other Messiah.
Though the synagogue of Satan will receive their false messiah and false prophet who is also a beastly temple builder (for he is the beast from the earth). For you are the temple of the living God, and there is no need of animal sacrifice ever again, for I am the final sacrifice, even the perfect, sinless Passover, and my works are complete and perfect. Therefore, there is never again a need for such a thing, but only that you come to me with your sins in repentance, and I will cleanse you from your dead works of the flesh. For in Romans it is written: For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For so have I freed you in me.
Understand, my tribes and my people, that the times of the Gentiles are at a close. The times of the Gentiles came about from the hardness of your fathers’ hearts. For what did Paul say in Acts on the matter: It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

I counsel you, my people, do not make the same mistakes and do not live the sins of your fathers, but repent of your own sins and also repent of the sins of your fathers, and come to me and I will receive you, for you are children of promise. And every yod or a thorn of a yod will be fulfilled; for what has been promised by Yahweh is impossible to change, for it is impossible for Yahweh to lie. Therefore, I am the fulfillment of many, many promises, for I am your true Messiah, even the image of the eternal God. For I am his only begotten son, even the Lamb of God whom John the Baptist identified for all time. For he said: Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the World!
And so I turned to the nations because my own land rejected me, even after I died for their sins and was resurrected. For I sent my apostles and prophets to them, and many were saved. For in the beginning of the age of grace, I sent them into the Temple and the synagogues, and many turned to me and accepted me as their Lord. And so I am calling you to be made whole in my Lordship, for I have redeemed you to my Father that you too may be His children by way of my spirit with which I will seal you. And so the times of the Gentiles are over, for now they too have rejected me in favor of another Jesus they worship as god, thus making themselves idolaters; for Satan thus tempted them. For there is but one God, the eternal Yahweh, and there is but one true Messiah, even me, Yeshua HaMashiach.
For they lost my mysteries, ignored my visions and the purposes of my holy scripture. They lost sight of the Father’s plan of redemption, and they arrogantly reject my words I had recorded to the Romans. For Paul stated: I say, then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew. And again: What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. And so the election was sure for those whom I have chosen from among the tribes; for my apostles were all of the land and of the promise, and so I sent them to the nations, of which your religious leaders blasphemously lie, calling them false. Those same false leaders and worthless shepherds even deny my resurrection, for I have been raised from the dead, and I die no more forevermore.
For what else say the Romans on the subject: David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense unto them: Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back always. I say, then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And so I declare that the fullness of the Gentiles has come, and the mysteries of God will be returned to Israel for the obedience of faith. For I will yet save Jacob, and a faithful remnant will turn to me faithfully, in great faith!
And so I am come to provoke jealousy in your hearts for me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and Yahweh the great eternal God who sent me, whom you no longer worship according to knowledge, for the veil of blindness will cover anyone who follows the law of Moses. For what did I say to the Corinthians on the subject: And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament; which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.

Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
For I have fulfilled the law of Moses, for neither you nor your fathers are able to achieve perfect compliance due to the sin in your blood. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have fulfilled the law to the fullest, and the law is only perfectly kept by faith in me, Jesus Christ. You are reckoned righteous by your complete identification with me, and so the just shall live by faith. And so I will remove the veil on your hearts so that you may see me, Yeshua, your true Messiah, for I have not abandoned you! And I come to you in the new testament, not the oldness of the letter. For I ratified my new covenant in my own blood, according to the will and promises of Yahweh, for your full redemption. And I will lead you to your inheritance, for the promises of God are yea and amen. Not even a yod or a thorn of a yod will fail, for all is about to be fulfilled; and in time, verily, will I fulfill all, for so am I sent of Yahweh to accomplish.
And so the Gentiles have turned from me like a dog returning to its vomit, and the time has come to leave them to it. For in my age of grace, not one person whom my Father has chosen for salvation has been missed, and none can pluck them from my hand. For those who confessed me, Jesus, as their Lord, with faith in their hearts that God raised me from the dead, were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, and my Father’s purposes have been fulfilled in me for them. And so shall they ever be with me.
For the olive tree reveals truth. And what did I say regarding the olive tree in Paul’s letter to the Romans: And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakes of the root and fatness of the olive tree; Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
And so they have made the mistakes and taken the sins of your fathers and have turned away from me to their idols, and they will no longer hear my voice. Though if they call on the name of the Lord, they will be saved who love not their lives to the end.
For what else says the witness of the Romans in scripture as a warning to the nations: Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high- minded, but fear: For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
And so, my kinsmen, the times of the Gentiles are at a close, and a huge shift is underway, where my grace will instantly turn to judgment. And even now the pieces are allowed into place by Satan’s hand, as he will make his stand, though he will be utterly crushed, and I will completely dismantle his kingdom; for he is no king.
And so now comes the time to graft the natural branches back into the olive tree, for Yahweh’s purposes

have been fulfilled in the undeserved grace and mercy that was shown to the Gentiles (for God’s grace and mercy are undeserved for every man), for even that grace and mercy was utilized to find the lost sheep of the house of Israel. For you should be not ignorant of your own history, providing you put down your blasphemous Babylonian Talmuds and learn of me; for I did not send that book, and you need to repent from those teachings and repudiate Satan’s lies. Return to my pure word of God and depart from your fathers’ sins, for I will redeem you if you will but hear my voice.
For I was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And so the ten tribes were scattered among the nations from their captivity by the Assyrians all this time ago. They have roamed and wandered the earth as pilgrims and sojourners. From Assyria they went into the lands of the north, into Scythia, and Europe, and eventually into the Americas, where I made them a peaceable habitation for a time. And I called all whoever may come from the nations to my salvation. Even many Israelites were saved and have been redeemed as well as many from the nations, who otherwise would have never had hope. And a multitude has responded, and so the times of the Gentiles are over, for there is no more time. But understand that all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved if they are faithful to the end, for I will receive them regardless of from the nation they originate.
And so it is, that Jacob’s trouble comes on the land and the nations, for it is time for great judgment to fall on the earth. And so the beasts by the power of the dragon shall rise; only take not his mark and do not fall for his deceptions. For he has already ingratiated himself to the rulers of your nation, even the synagogue of Satan with their Edomite ways. And he already speaks great blasphemies, for he is being prepared for his true purpose.
For the abomination of desolation is coming. For what did I have my faithful Luke record for all time: And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
And so it shall be at the proper time, and I will protect my own, for I am sending you as my prophets, shepherds, healers, and ministers. For I am calling you to service, even to fulfill your true calling given by promise to the fathers by Yahweh Himself, and by my hand shall they be fulfilled. For Yahweh has set my seat in His throne, and I have shared of my throne with my Bride, who are ever with me. And so there is none on earth greater than me; none of your false prophets compare, for they are all weak and beggarly and sent to deceive and lead astray, for they are worthless shepherds.
Know, my people, that the enemy has set many traps for you, so follow my lead and you will avoid them all. For very soon all pleasures will be taken from the earth. Many will not even find a morsel, and they won’t even have a table to eat at but will be fugitives in the earth for their faith in me.
Do not let yourselves be tempted by their false manna that will require the mark of the beast to attain entrance into their perverse society. For the mark will not be forgiven, and all who fall into this trap will not be released; for it is permanent for all who make that final choice of finality, for they will have sealed their fate and that fate is final. So do not be tempted by the bait, or you will wind up in the net and hooked permanently through your jaw.

I am sending you to gather my flock, and I will lead you to them and lead them to you, and you will shepherd them for me, for I am the chief shepherd. You will not deny another race or country or any other nation, for Yahweh’s promise stands, and all who call on the name of the Lord will be saved. Do not be stiffnecked as your fathers, and be meek to my voice. For your fathers rejected me, so confess the sins of your fathers and your own in repentance to me, and I will forgive you and shower you in my love and grace, for I will make rivers of living waters flow from your belly. I have empowered you for great miracles. And I am sending you to your brethren to turn them to me, for a remnant will yet be saved; and I will save Jacob from the hand of their enemies, for I have declared it and so it will be fulfilled.
I, even Yeshua HaMashiach that Yahweh has sent, am the true Messiah of Israel and the world. Even I will send my two prophets, even those whom Yahweh snatched from the earth in their times: for such a purpose were they taken, and so shall they be sent. I have many things to say to you and those things will be said, and I will prepare you for your missions, and you will do great and mighty works for me, even works you never imagined possible. For the worst of times always produce great men of Yahweh, even men who will not be broken, for you will rest in my strength, and I am unbreakable. For so has Yahweh made me, and so I will make you. So hear my voice, for I am calling and will send my angels to seal the 144,000 with the seal of Yahweh.
I will keep you in safety from the beast and his abomination; I will hide you, and you will be fed from the heavens even should you need, so fear not. Fear not for your lives, for great reward is yours for service and faithfulness, and I will reward you for your stand.
I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and you will hear my roar, for I am calling you.
I am he that will seal 12,000 from each tribe except Dan and Ephraim.
I am he who will crush the lion’s whelp that will spring from Dan.
I am he who will defeat the beast and the false prophet, and I will cast them alive into the great lake of fire.
I am he who will lead my people to green pastures by my shepherds, for I am the chief shepherd.
I am he who will fulfill the promises made to the fathers, for so am I sent.
I am he that will crush the head of the Satans, for the princes of this world will pay.
I am he that will rule from the throne of David, for my kingdom has no end.
I am he who is coming in the clouds, and I will come to my own nation and will take my rule, and I will not be stopped.
I, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent these words for those whom I am calling. So hear my words in obedience, and know that I will liberate the land and the entire earth and will rule in righteousness. So hear my call, for I am coming to you and will teach you my ways and will guide you into all truth. So reject not my writings, for the oracles of God will be returned to Israel, and the earth will know that there is a God in Israel, even Yahweh, the great eternal God, for there is none else, and there is none like Him. Shalom! Shalom! So be in peace and be well, for I will heal you all to the uttermost who put their faith in Yeshua HaMashiach.

The Mystery of the Little Book: Explanation of the Seven Thunders
MAY 17, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach:
Behold, the mystery of the little book! For seven angels do send their thunders, and the thunders have uttered their voices. They are the mystery of the little book, for the little book was sealed. For a voice came from heaven, telling John the Revelator: Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. Behold, you ate of the little book, for it has been revealed, and it was as sweet as honey in your ears as you slept, but it was bitter in your belly which woke you from the vision; and behold, you awoke from your slumber! Behold, the mystery of the little book has come to be revealed in this time, for it is the last mystery to be revealed in my age of grace, even the little book of sweet bitter. For the voices of the thunders are to be revealed, and now is the time of revealing, for the mystery of the little book is great, though it be the little book. For that little book was revealed to John the Revelator, and now I will reveal it to you, for its revelation is at hand. Hear my voice, my bride, and incline your ear to me, Christ Jesus, for the time has come. For there is no more time.
I am the son of God come in the flesh, and I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent these words.
From Yahweh, the eternal God:
The voice of the seven thunders SPEAKS! Prepare yourselves, oh, you nations, for great judgment is upon you, and the words of the seven thunders are revealed. Turn your ears to hear the sayings of the mystery of The Little Book. For the scrolls will be unsealed, and the loosening of the seals is coming upon the entire world, even great judgment and calamity. For the sins of the earth are a stench in my nostrils, and I, even Yahweh, will cleanse the earth, and I will demolish every evil thing; and my son, whom I am sending, will rule in righteousness on the earth, and great peace will be for the faithful whom I have protected from the evil day. And great peace will I provide to all who call on the name of Jesus Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach, for all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. And in peace and safety will I lead them, and in righteousness will I clothe them, and in true holiness will they glorify me; for I have glorified them, and newness of life will they have.
So I bring my justice and wrath that I may recompense those who commit evil with their own filthy ways, so whoever refuses me and chooses evil, let them be evil still, and the wrath of God abides! And whosoever shall be righteous and all who depart from evil as they call on the name of the Lord will have great reward; so let them have the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and they will have great inheritance in my son, Christ Jesus, who has their reward in his hand. So whoever that will be evil, let them be evil still. And whoever turns to righteousness and calls on the name of the Lord, let them be righteous still, for the day shall declare it.
Behold, a thing I will tell you before it happens, for prophecies are about to be fulfilled, and there will be no more delay. For times of grace and mercy are coming to a close, and a time of great wrath is about to be

unleashed on the earth, and there has never been a time such as this on the earth, not even during the days of Noah, and never will there be such a time again. For I, even I, have sworn by my name and have declared these things. Whatsoever I, even Yahweh the eternal God, declares cannot be changed and will come to pass. For in the days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, even the mystery of God should be finished.

And now for further insight on the part of this message where Yeshua HaMashiach stated, “Behold, you ate of the little book, for it has been revealed, and it was as sweet as honey in your ears as you slept, but it was bitter in your belly which woke you from the vision; and behold, you awoke from your slumber.” Some time ago in the past month or so, I don’t know the exact date, but I was asleep in the middle of the night, and I woke into a vision from my sleep (or it was a very vivid dream and I woke up at the start). A voice was reading words into my mind and spirit, and I knew it was the Lord’s voice, and he was reading in my ears words that I couldn’t understand because the words just flowed nonstop. But with the words came a great peace that settled completely over me. The words were very sweet in my ears, and I was at rest. Then suddenly, I came out of that state with a very bad case of reflux, my stomach was twisted, and I shot up out of bed, choking and coughing. I went downstairs and drank a lot of water, which helped a little but didn’t settle my stomach down. I was awake for a while after that, but I didn’t know what any of this meant.
And for the testimony, where Yahweh says, “The voice of the seven thunders SPEAKS!” On May 7, 2024, I had a particularly rough day, and I came home and went to bed pretty early. I had been up pretty late the night before because I couldn’t sleep, which happens a lot with me. There was a bad storm with heavy rain when I lied down, but all lightning and thunder were far off in the distance. I lied down to go to sleep around 7 o’clock that night, which is early for me, and I drifted off into what I thought was sleep. I don’t know if I ever really went to sleep, but I went into a vision or very vivid dream state, and I was hyper aware of the storm that was going on. Words and voices were coming at me from what appeared various directions, and they were everywhere. I don’t remember the content of the various voices, except one. It was a very distinct voice, and all the other voices went silent. The voice said, “The voice of the seven thunders SPEAKS!” When those words were spoken, I was immediately wakened by the loudest crack of thunder I have ever heard. I sat there in my bed, totally astounded.
When I shared this with my wife a day or two later, we were on our front porch. She took me by the hand and let me around the house toward the backyard. She told me that she and our son were in the living room when that thunder shock struck. The flash of lightning had lit up and shook the living room. Clearly, it had struck in the immediate vicinity of our backyard, which is fairly small, as we live in the city. Yet we saw no damage anywhere. I have seen the aftermath when lightning violently strikes the earth or something on the earth, and it and leaves destruction on some level or another. She saw the flash of lightning, and we both heard the extremely loud thunder shock, yet absolutely no damage was anywhere to be found.

The Lord has revealed to me exactly what this work is, and it is titled thusly. I have received the contents of The Little Book that is in the hands of the mighty Angel in Revelation 10, who is clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was on his head and his face was as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. These represent the ages and corresponding covenants, which all culminate in the face of Jesus Christ, the only begotten of Yahweh, and the image of the eternal God.
The rainbow is the sign given at the Noahic covenant that Yahweh made with Noah after the deluge. A cloud and pillars of fire represent God’s covenant with Moses. Yeshua HaMashiach’s face shines like the sun and is the new covenant. These seven messages contain judgment on the fallen ones and others from before the flood of Noah all the way through to the end, in what is still future as of today’s date.

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE REVELATOR
The Times Have Come! (Thunders Three & Four)
MAY 16, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach:
Behold! The times of separation draw to a close, and my appearing has almost arrived now. It is very close and even the angels and host of heaven are at the trumpet’s call. I have reached my outstretched arms to a dying world for many jubilees now, and many have accepted the peace treaty that my Father, Yahweh, sent to mankind, even me, Christ Jesus, for I am your peace. Yet many more have rejected my offer and my Father’s grace and mercy that has been poured out on the earth.
Those who have been sealed and redeemed are those chosen from the foundation of the world. For my Father knew you from eternity to eternity, and you have always been at the center of his heart, as I have also been in the center of his heart, for I, Jesus the Nazarene, am Yahweh’s only begotten son. And yet by my accomplished works as the perfect Passover and by the obedience of the only begotten, many, many sons of God have been born again into all eternity, even taken from the sons of men, for I am the Son of Man!
These times of grace were a mystery hidden in Yahweh’s heart that he told nobody until he revealed it to me, and I have revealed it to my holy apostles and prophets and have preserved my holy Word for the ears and hearts of the chosen and faithful. For you, my Bride ,are part of the great mystery of God, and your lives (which are hidden in me) are about to be revealed. And I will reward the faithful for all their faithful works that they have faithfully done in great faith to me, Jesus Christ.
And so have I saved great multitudes by my atoning blood, for my blood was sinless and to this day I am sinless, for I will never sin. Those who have lived their lives faithfully in Christ will receive great reward, and they will shine as the stars in heaven, and great glory is theirs to be had, for they did not glorify themselves as if they were some great ones. But they have glorified me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I will present them to my Father without stain or wrinkle, and their garments will be snow white and never will they be soiled. And they shall all live and never again sin, either through ungodliness or through pride. And they will be glorified in me.
For I am the chief shepherd, and I have led my flock to green pastures until the times of consummation, which are quickly coming upon the earth, for there is no more sand remaining to pass through the glass. And I will reward all, from the least to the greatest, in such a manner that you cannot comprehend at this time; but that comprehension is at your doorstep, for you will be taken into the heavens so very soon. And so shall my Bride be taken into glory, where I will judge her works and fully redeem every last man, woman, and child. I will reward them richly for even the smallest things that have been accomplished in service to me. For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have shown toward his Name, in that you have ministered to the Saints, and do minister.
Fear not, my Bride, for God does not judge as man judges, for man is unjust and a respecter of persons. Man glorifies those whom man deems important, and natural man most always ignores humility and

55

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

virtue in favor of the haughty and self-accomplished. For natural man cries out to be accounted righteous before God, but natural man cannot overcome his sin nature and refuses to believe that he is corrupt, even denying the Lord of Lords, who would save him.
And so pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Instead of bowing their hearts to my words and wisdom and love that I have flooded on the earth, natural man instead chooses to follow his lusts and passions, for the courses of the world are designed by Satan to tempt and incite those passions, even the rewards of unrighteousness. And so the times of the Gentiles are coming to a close, and it is time for Jacob’s trouble; for I will redeem Israel, even my faithful elect, who will come to me in repentance for their sins and the sins of their fathers who rejected me. And as it has been written, so let it be done.
Oh, natural man, why do you yet choose your sins and ignore my grace and salvation as if that is a light thing? Neither Yahweh nor I, Christ Jesus, have any pleasure in the coming judgments and the utter terror that will soon be unleashed. But God has not chosen this part of his plan so that he could be cruel to his creation: for God is love, and God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. The coming great trouble is designed to give mankind one last chance before it is too late for him. A great multitude will be saved out of the tribulation, even those who hold my name to their last breath and love not their lives to the end.
Natural man, you are so stubborn, and you will not listen, and you foolishly reject my grace, and I still pray the same: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. For those who are left to great trouble, even those who have rejected my offer of peace, many will be lost to destruction, for they have rejected the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, many will be saved, even all that call on the name of the Lord will be saved. And so yet the trials of fire are about to begin, for judgment approaches.
Great judgment is coming on Satan’s kingdom! And you, natural man, even in your stubborn unbelief, refuse even the easiest request. For in my times of grace, salvation has been free and easy, and all one had to do was confess Jesus as Lord and believe God raised me from the dead. And so now there will be a famine of all things good in the land, even my Holy Word. A great, great time of trouble is approaching, and Satan foolishly prepares to make his stand, even arrogantly thinking he can win so that he and his angels can have a world of their own, a world without God, because their ways are perverse. Verily, that which has made itself crooked cannot be made straight, and there is no forgiveness nor peace to Satan and his angels, nor their offspring.
I am the son of God who has come in the flesh.
I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.
I am he who will rule the nations with a rod of iron.
I am he who will unleash the seals so very soon.
I am he who is coming for my Bride.
I am he who shall meet you in the air.
I am that I am, and the trumpet is about to sound.
I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have sent these Words.

The BITTER SWEET

From Yahweh, the Great Eternal God:
Now comes the judgment of the eternal God, even Yahweh, for I am sending my Son, and there is no time remaining. Oh, you worthless ones who thought you could defeat Yahweh, even the great eternal God! Oh, you worthless ones who foolishly thought you could defeat my only begotten Son, Yeshua HaMashiach. You have heaped to yourselves eternal wrath, and my anger is fierce against you, for I am a jealous God. For from the beginning you have withstood my plans, and you have vexed, distressed, persecuted, tortured, and destroyed my creation. You have no peace.
Hear me and hear me well, for I declare what will become of you, and what Yahweh declares can no one alter, not once, not ever. And so your judgment comes. I will send my Son to gather my chosen and faithful, even the sons of Adam who have now become sons of God. You have failed, oh, you worthless serpent, who slithers in dishonesty and falsehood. For you are no gods, and you cannot ever deliver yourselves from my hand. For I will repay!
I will return to you every evil work and all the pain and suffering you have caused the innocent, and you will burn forever in the hottest flames of blue, and acrid poisonous smoke shall be your air, and in great torment will you forever be. For you caused me to destroy my creation, even the earth as it was before the flood of Noah, even on account of your worthless seed that you made for mankind’s destruction; and so on account of these things, I will destroy you in your inheritance of fire.
And you tried to destroy the world after the flood of Noah, even making your abominations once again, but they will have no root nor branch; for all the tares will be plucked up, bound, and cast into the fire. And so will I destroy the earth in fiery judgment, for I promised never to flood the entire earth again. But in fire my judgment comes, for I am an all-consuming fire, and my anger boils over at the wicked. And so on account of these things, I will destroy you in the hottest fire and burning brimstone.
Hear me and hear me well, for I declare what will become of you, even you worthless watchers who left your first estate. You have no peace, and though I have unleashed you from your bonds for a short season, I have only done so in order that you may serve my purposes. Then great judgment is on you, and you have no peace. For you caused me to flood the earth on account of your abominations. Who are you to play creator with Yahweh’s creation? Who are you to desecrate the garden of God with your unclean ways? You made your bastards and reprobates by defiling yourselves with women, and they will share in your inheritance of fire.
For what did I tell Malachi: For behold, the day comes that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that comes, shall burn them up, says the Lord of Hosts, and shall leave them neither root nor branch.
Behold that day surely approaches, and all of you will pay according to your own evil ways.
For I have given men wives that they may be lacking nothing, wives for companionship and to bear them children. But you descended on Mount Hermon, even leaving your first estate of glory, and you have defiled yourselves with women, and you have no peace nor rest. As I had Enoch the scribe tell you in the age of your offense: You have no peace: a severe sentence has gone forth against thee to put thee in bonds: And thou shalt not have toleration nor request granted to you, because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all the works of godlessness and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast

shown to men. And in bonds you shall go as you are cast into the lake of fire.
You harmed my creation for your own lusts, even forcefully taking many you chose as your wives, and you will pay. You have joined the Satans, even the princes who arrayed themselves against me, and you chose the lies of the seraphim. Therefore, you will join them in the great eternal lake of fire, and you will forever burn, and never will you have rest. You have hurt my creation and killed so many, and you have no regard for the lives I have created. Therefore, I will have no regard for you, and I have created you, and now comes your judgment and eventual destruction.
I say to the Satans, the watchers, the fallen cherubim, the fallen seraphim, even all who have joined the Satans’ rebellion: you will utterly burn, over and over again for all eternity; for I will bind you and cast you into the fire where your worm dies not, even the flames reserved for you worthless ones that will burn the hottest flames just for you, for you are worthy. For I will do to you exactly what you have done to others. All the pain, sadness, regret, suffering, even every detestable act will be recompensed to you for all time, and you will not escape. I will lay you bare before the nations and expose you for the frauds you are, and they will say to the little gods (who are no gods): Art thou also become weak as we? Are thou become like unto us?
I will utterly recompense your evil ways back into your own bosoms, and you will forever pay. You will be cast alive into the flames, and you will burn in the presence of the Lamb, and the angels and all the righteous ones you have wronged will receive from me a multitude over what you took from them. For when you are recompensed of your evil, I will have recompensed my chosen and faithful children with great reward that will exceed what you have taken a multitude over and above your worthless actions.
And so shall it be. I will create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness, and my children will live with me, and I will make my dwelling among men, and so shall it be. But you will burn in your evil ways, and every evil thing you have done will be returned to you for eternity. And so I will set the seal, and you will be forgotten, and you will not come to mind. And all shall dwell in peace, and you will never have peace.
Behold, time is up, and I am sending my Son for his Bride, even Jesus Christ the Righteous! For in him I am well pleased! And all that he has saved and made whole from your worthless ways, even those you have accused unjustly, will rest in me and have perfect peace, joy, and love. For I will make you as them and make them more glorious than you once were, and you have no kingdom, for you are no king.
Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, for great wrath is on you. For you have rejected your creator and you love death. For to reject me is to love death, and in dying you shall die. My wrath is hot against you, and I will take all pleasures away, all joy, even your basic needs will go unmet. For when I showered you in grace and mercy, you chose instead to use grace as an occasion to join the worthless ones, even Satan’s kingdom, when you could have escaped. And so now many will perish, whose names were never written in the Book of Life from the beginning. My Son, Jesus Christ, is approaching, and he will snatch his bride into the heavens, and I will remove the restrainer. Behold! I send giants to fulfill my wrath! You took my grace and mercy in vain and have lived lives of sinful pleasure, and I will repay.
For when you could have had peace for all eternity, even an eternal life of full joy and happiness, you chose your own deaths, and I will give you what you desire. You want a world of evil and darkness; I will give you

exactly what you desire, and I will also recompense you for all the pain you caused others as you lived in great sin. I will strip from you all pleasure, and you will eat of the filth of your ways. Great judgment is on the earth, and there will be no more delay.
Behold! All who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For a great multitude will be saved from the tribulation that is coming, and I will receive them to myself. For it is written: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
I urge you all to call on the name of Jesus Christ, the true Messiah, even the only begotten son of God, for he is coming, and the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of Yahweh are about to be unleashed.
I am Yahweh, the great eternal God.
I am El Shaddai, God Almighty.
I am Jehovah Jireh.
I am the great Elohim, the God of Israel.
I am he that sent his only begotten son to redeem those who would be redeemed.
I am he that has raised Christ Jesus from the dead and given him a name above every name, that every knee should bow and every tongue will confess.
I AM the Great I AM, and my wrath is soon to be fulfilled, and there is none greater, and I have spoken.
I, Yahweh, the great eternal God, have sent the words I have sent, and I have sent these words. I have sent my son, Yeshua HaMashiach, and he has sent his words to the faithful. Time is up.

Behold, My Reward Is with Me!
MAY 15, 2024
To my faithful, beloved Bride, who have fully loved me with their entire heart. You are the apple of my eye, and soon I am coming for you, sooner than you imagine. For your faithfulness, there is great reward in the heavens that has been prepared for you. Behold! Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. And so are the amazing truths concerning you, my love, for you will share in my inheritance according as your faithfulness testifies at my judgment seat, even that great Bema, where I will judge the works of each of my called and chosen and faithful.
For those whose works burn, they will suffer loss, but they themselves shall be saved so as yet by fire; and for those whose works abide, they will receive much treasure, for the day will soon declare it. For this is not a foreign concept to you, but one you have learned from the witness of the Corinthians in Paul’s second letter: For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and, I trust also, are made manifest in your consciences.
For your conscience will testify with your words when you will soon give an account of yourselves before the righteous Judge, even me, Jesus Christ. Some will stand before me and present their own works that will be burnt up by the refiner’s fire that will result in shame and loss. Some will stand before me upright, having washed themselves in my atoning blood, where you will present me the works that I gave you to do. For to enter into my rest is to rest from your own works. So for those who have rested in my works is great reward for the faithful. But you all will be saved, and not one of you has walked completely perfectly before me, and so the day shall declare it. Fear not, I will reward you to the uttermost, for all the mighty works you have done for me in secret will be made manifest, so the day shall declare it.
Why do your hearts trouble you at these sayings? Have you not read in the first letter of John, where I had him write? For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. And again: If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So, confess your sins to me daily and as often as you’d like, and wash yourselves in my atoning blood.
For I am your intercessor, and you were purchased by my sacrifice as the perfect Passover to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness. Behold, my Bride! The times of restitution are at hand, for Peter prophesied of this time when he healed the man at the Temple Gate Beautiful: And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you. Whom the heaven must receive, until the times of restitution of all things. And now comes the times of restitution, my beautiful Bride, for you are pure before me and are cleansed from all unrighteousness in the blood of the Lamb, for I am the Lamb of God! Therefore, confess your sins faithfully.

61

The BITTER SWEET

And so judgment, restitution, loss, and great reward all start with the house of God. For shortly, you will be gathered together in the clouds to meet me in the air, for I will descend from the heavens with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and the last trumpet shall sound! Continue to watch the skies and observe, for God has done many mighty signs in the heavens, even announcing the marriage of the bridegroom to his bride, even the eternal covenant between me and my bride, which is soon to occur. So confess your sins and ask me to show you the sins you have forgotten so you may confess those as well; and above all, stand firm in the love of God, for the love of God covers a multitude of sins. So fear not, because it is impossible for you to confess them all.
Of judgment: because you have passed from death unto life in me, your resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. For I gave my life; nobody took it. I willingly gave it and I would do it again if needed. But there is no need for such a thing, for what did I tell the Hebrews: For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats, should take away sins. But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God. My Bride, I will not judge you according to your sins; for all that are in Christ are justified, yea sanctified, even made righteous in me, Christ Jesus, who will live and reign forever, for my kingdom has no end. So you are acquitted of your sins; therefore, you will not be in the judgment of sinners but the judgment of the righteous, for judgment begins at the house of God.
Of restitution: because I will repay, saith the Lord. So many of you have left houses, countries, families and sacrificed many, many things; and many among my Bride even gave their lives, they are my Martyrs. So there will be a restitution of the things sacrificed and even lost. For what was the end of Job: And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. And the voice of James my brother also states: Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord: that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. And so is your Father, and so I am, for I am of the great I AM!
Of loss: for many will suffer loss, for I have stated regarding my judgment seat to the Corinthians: For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad. And again the Corinthians testify: Every man’s work shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work shall be burnt, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved: yet so, as by fire.
Of great reward: for the Corinthians speak again: Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. My faithful and chosen, you simply cannot comprehend the great celebrations and banquets prepared for you by my Father in the heavens; for you are coming in celebration, and great treasure is treasured up for you in the heavens. (For you are coming home to me, Christ Jesus, and our Father, Yahweh, the eternal God.) And again: if any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. I have so many rewards to give, and my inheritance is with me; so fear not, for you will share in my inheritance; and where I am, so too shall you be, for the times of separation are over.
Crowns of reward and authority are waiting for you. I have listed some in scripture: the incorruptible crown, the crown of rejoicing, the crown of righteousness, the crown of glory, and the crown of life.
For those who have run the race, even the courses of service I set for them, will receive the incorruptible

62

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

crown: for you will have had yourselves in subjection to my spirit, and you will have disciplined yourselves accordingly as any athlete would. For those who have won the race lawfully is the incorruptible crown.
There is a crown of rejoicing. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For, ye are our glory and joy. And so we will have great joy, and you all will be in glory and glorified in me! For those who faithfully worked to convert and raise up your brethren is the crown of rejoicing. There is the crown of righteousness for those who finish their courses and for those who love my appearing. So keep looking up, for I am near and have great expectation for my appearing. For great expectation for my appearing also brings great reward. For those with great expectation for my appearing is the crown of righteousness.
There is the crown of glory for those who have fed the flock of God. For Peter wrote: feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind. For those who didn’t lord themselves over God’s heritage and weren’t motivated by filthy lucre and who have faithfully served me with humility and the proper heart of love is the crown of glory.
There is the crown of life that I will give to my martyrs, for those who suffer tribulation and persecution for my namesake and for those who have endured patiently the devil’s wiles and schemes. For those who have faithfully overcome these things is the crown of life.
You will also be made like me, the last Adam and you will be like me, and you will see me as I am, and so too shall you be. Behold! I will re-create new bodies for you that are unlike anything you can imagine. See the records in scripture where I appeared to my faithful before being ascended into the heavens. I will tailor this body specifically to you, and it will carry your abilities, achievements, accomplishments; and you will be utterly amazed.
Do you not understand what I had Paul write to the Corinthians? There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars: for one star is different from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. My children, you will have so many abilities you never dreamed of. Though each of you will be different from another, you will all move perfectly in me, for I will make you kings and priests before our God!
There will be so many things you will no longer be burdened with. There will be no more sickness, no more sin for you, no more death for you, no more fear, no worry; for you will all be re-created perfectly in me, Christ Jesus the Lord. So I say to you, my Bride, be an overcomer, for the rewards of the overcomer will I give, and it is beyond your wildest imaginations and dreams. For the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God, and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him. And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads. And there shall be no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light, and they shall reign forever and ever. So fear not, my faithful Bride, great reward is so soon to be realized for you. For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labor of love, which you have shewed toward his Name, in that you have ministered to the Saints, and do minister.
I am coming for you, sooner than you imagine.

To my Church, my Body, even my Bride: I ask you to lend your ears to my wisdom and hear my voice, for I will now speak to you. Are you listening? Put aside your various and sundry man-made doctrines and so-called theologies, and incline your heart to Holy Scripture, even my pure word. Set aside your leavened doctrines, for any admixture of the Words of God, even the pure Word of God, leavens the entire lump of dough and you no longer have scripture. For I am the Word of God made flesh, and I dwell within you, and I am calling you to your home in the heavens so very soon.
Put your commentaries away, and quit listening to so many untruthful voices, even voices that are not mine; but instead, hold my Words in your hearts and compare them to scripture so that you may have faith in my Words and faith in me, Christ Jesus. For if one comes to you who speaks not the doctrine of the Lord, even the pure Words of God, do not even wish him godspeed. For I will make you wise in my Holy Scripture, even the Word of life, and my wisdom does not corrupt. So gather your treasures together in heaven, where neither rust nor moths corrupt, and where thieves neither break up nor yet steal. For wheresoever your treasure is, there will your hearts be also. My children, I am your treasure, so keep your thoughts and hearts solely on me in singleness of mind.
Have you not read the Words that reveal this great mystery of God? For we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellent power of it might appear to be of God, and not of us. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. So fear not, for you have been born again of my holy spirit; therefore, understand the Words of my Word. For I will tell you wisdom that will comfort you and keep you from strong delusion that has overtaken the world; for the world is chained for judgment and is in great fear and distress.
Therefore, I have come to speak to you so that I may testify to the wise among you of two world leaders who currently appear as virtuous shepherds, even sheep elected from among the flock to serve in civic duty, who appear to have come to shepherd the lost sheep of Mystery Babylon to safety. But these two mangy shepherds are no sheep, but they are evil beasts disguised as sheep and are from a different fold, even the shepherd dragon’s very own. The shepherd dragon is not a true shepherd of the sheep, for his flock is no flock but a host of fallen ones who have fallen from glory and have become all manner of unclean things fit for destruction. I speak of the current deception that is being used to set the stage for the rising of the unholy three. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there is an unholy three that are rising (even a great counterfeit of the three that bear record in heaven): the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet (who is also a beast). And these brute beasts are made for destruction, for their future is burning fire and brimstone in that great lake of fire that burns white flames of blue in the blackness of darkness forever.
I speak to their current state and present rule, for they have not yet been fully revealed, for the restrainer is still present; but I will identify them to my faithful, even those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.

Understand that these deceivers work great deception even before their revealing and true empowerment, for they will be given authority from the dragon; for such is given him for a very short time and in a limited fashion to test and try the earth, and to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And though the mystery of iniquity works mightily for these purposes, their revealing is not yet but is at hand.
For even now they appear as great men, benevolent men, men of valor and philanthropy, who live lives of selfless service. But do not be deceived by the mangy shepherds, for they appear clean and pure to the masses who will already wonder after them and soon will say: Who is like unto the beast? (For even now they lead astray the lost, who are enchanted by their witchcraft.) But for those with eyes to see and ears to hear, they appear as they truly are: for they are mangy shepherds who receive their power from the great dragon, even Satan himself. For one will rise from the sea and is currently working in secret (behind the facade of a propped up old stooge) for the destruction of Mystery Babylon; and the other will rise from the earth and is sent falsely to those in the Promised Land and will be the false prophet for the synagogue of Satan, even their false Moshiach.
For the beastly false prophet is in collusion with the beast, who rules in secret, and they both work together to fully advance the mystery of iniquity, that they may soon be revealed; for their times have come, though they have no kingdom as yet. Do not succumb to the delusion, for the one mangy shepherd who rules in secret puppeteers the old stooge, while the other mangy shepherd who appears persecuted by the old stooge works hand in hand with the mangy shepherd who rules in secret. For they pretend they are enemies at the present time, but they are all from the same mangy flock, fulfilling the dragon’s purposes.
Sadly, many who think they are saved by faithlessly confessing Jesus as Lord from an unbelieving heart on lips of unbelief (for with the heart man believes unto righteousness) are enchanted by these demons, and they will deceive my very elect if possible, even the ones who ignorantly follow them. For these shepherds are not pure, and their cloaks are made of wool that is dirty and diseased, for they are mangy shepherds tending a mangy flock, and by their fruits you will know them.
They are not pure and white as snow, like my sheep; for I am the Lamb without spot and blemish, who was selected from the flock to be the perfect Passover for all time. I cleanse my sheep in my atoning blood, and no mange is found in them. Though they claim they are sent by God Almighty, God Almighty did not send them. Though many false prophets falsely testify regarding him, I have not sent him, but the dragon. For I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and there are no other lambs but me, Christ Jesus.
Salvation is in my name alone, for no other name is given amongst men whereby men might be saved except mine, the Lord Jesus. For there is not one person whom I intend to receive my Words that will not hear them. If they receive my words in faith or if they faithlessly reject them is a choice the Father has empowered each one to make, for God forces himself and his love on not one person. And I am coming to execute judgment upon all and to convict all that are ungodly amongst them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
I have spoken to you in many ways, and in my many works have I sent my prophets and ministers, for time is up. And so I will speak of things unconfirmed to previous generations but are now revealed, for the times of my revealing have come. For I am about to be revealed from the heavens, even me, for I am the true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach. And I will speak in parables to them that are without, but those who

have eyes to see and ears to hear will understand, for I will confirm it in my spirit that is created in them.
I am come to speak of the words that John the Revelator was given, and I will make the way plain to you if you will receive my Words and humble your hearts to my voice.
Behold! I speak of two coming rulers who work in tandem, and they will deceive the World and take many with them to the fires of the abyss. Even those whose names are not written in the Book of Life will follow them and will be stricken with the serpent’s bite, of which the world has been warned, even the mark of which no man will be healed; for the warnings are final, and what God has declared is impossible to change.
These leaders, even the mangy shepherds, currently masquerade themselves as civil servants of Mystery Babylon. For under the mangy shepherd’s cloaks they wear (for each is disguised in his own way), they are ravenous beasts whose lust can never be satisfied, and they will demand all to worship them and the image of the beast and the dragon as if they are God; for they are about to be unleashed when the restrainer is removed.
For very soon and suddenly, when I gather my Church to me in the clouds, sudden destruction will overtake the earth; for they will destroy Secret Babylon, and great war will break across the land and sudden destruction will overtake the earth. The unholy trio will rise from the ashes of the ruins and chaos left by the horseman, who are soon to be unleashed after my Bride is snatched away to me in the heavens. (For only then will I open the seals of my testament for my Church is saved from the wrath to come, and I will rescue them.) They will rise from the ashes of war, pestilence, famine, and great injustice, and from the deaths of many, many multitudes.
They will offer peace and safety, and they will speak many lies which they will pass for the wisdom of God, and will speak many blasphemous and damnable things; and one will point to the other, and in their hand will be their solution, even their venom which cannot be undone nor forgiven. For everyone who gives themselves to the serpent’s bite, forever marked will they forever be. But such will be the price to enter their new society, even their new order made by Satan and his angels that they foolishly make for their abominable seed.
They will promise a new society free from the death and destruction that is soon to come on the entire world, when sudden destruction comes at the gathering of my Church. (They seek to rekindle their golden age that God destroyed in the flood of Noah.) They will offer peace, long life, freedom from disease, health and safety, and a new day will they promise. But these two mangy shepherds (who appear as though they are from the flock) will claim that God Almighty has sent them, and the entire world will wonder after them, but they are no shepherds. I ask you, can a dragon shepherd a flock? When has a dragon ever tended the sheep, except to seal their utter destruction and separation from the Father of Lights, even Yahweh? For the beast and the false prophet will receive their power from the dragon, and they are slaves to the dragon’s lusts and will.
At the time of their revealing they will throw off their disguises of lowly civil servants; and all the pomp, even their mangy cloaks of mangy sheepskins and their true nature, power, and purposes will be revealed. The world will wonder after them and their ways, even worshiping them to their own destruction. They will step on the world stage in great power, and an alliance of ten kings will rule. Even now, the alliance has already arrayed their hosts in secret for a secret attack on Secret Babylon. They have secretly set themselves

to the ready, and they have surely coordinated an attack, and they have openly invaded Secret Babylon according to the judgment declared by God that is about to befall her, of which she shall never again rise.
For her iniquities have come before the most High, and her sins before the great throne of heaven, even before the great eternal God, for there is none greater; and judgment has been pronounced on her. For El Shaddai even uses the hands of his enemies to fulfill his plans and even his enemies obey his voice; for who can stand against God Almighty? Make no mistake, the two mangy shepherds currently are in collusion behind the image of a stooge. They have not yet been revealed to the World, and when they are, the world will wonder after them and follow them to their demise. Yet they are no sheep at all, but they are raging beasts on the inside who will soon have great power bestowed on them by the dragon, for such is given to him for a short season. For they will set themselves against, and in place of, the good shepherd; except those with spiritual discernment will see the mange, even the evil and utter depravity that is within them, for they are of an impure nature and are evil to the depth of their beings. You already know who they pretend to be, but you do not know who they truly are, and they have even given themselves fake names, so the number cannot be counted.
For the beast who will rise from the sea to rule the nations has already been, and appears that he now is not but in reality still is, even guiding the hands of a mindless old puppet. This is he who is named in Hebrew using the words I spoke when I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Lightning fall from heaven: study to learn. For he does not desire women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. I ask you now and see whether a man does travail with child? Yet his wife appears a woman with children, though they are not his children.
The beast to rise from the earth you already know, and many of you ignorantly follow, even being deceived already when you should be preaching against the deception. For he is from the land, but of his tribe is not one person sealed of the 144,000. And of Dan he said, Dan is a Lion’s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan, and he is from the tribe of Dan, even proud of his bloodline, for blue blood flows in his veins. He is identified as a modern-day Cyrus and will be a temple builder so that he may bring about the abomination of desolation in his time, and presently already builds in the Promised Land for the synagogue of Satan.
My little ones, I leave you with wisdom to ponder, and these are no longer mysteries but have been revealed in their time. Only their times will not be revealed to the world until the restrainer is removed, and it will happen much more quickly than you realize. For these things are about to come to pass. and there is no more time, for the numbers have fallen from the clock face. Stay faithful in me, and when I have confirmed in your spirit their identity, convert your brethren. Behold, my appearing is nearly accomplished.
I am the Word of God made flesh, and I dwell within you.
I am calling you to your home in the heavens so very soon.
I am the Lamb without spot and blemish.
I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. I am the true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach.
I am coming to execute judgment upon all.
I am come to speak of the words that John the Revelator was given.

IN THE WORKS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
Sinners! Come to Me in This Last Time!
MAY 10, 2024
Hear my Words, even the Words of Jesus the Nazarene, for I am coming to you in the spirit of love, compassion, humility, grace, and especially mercy. For soon my grace and mercy will be replaced with great trouble, even Jacob’s trouble, and this entire seven- year period will be unlike anything the earth has ever seen, even since the beginning of creation. It will begin with sudden destruction and persecution that will only intensify. Therefore, I come this last time to the sinners who have not yet repented in my grace and mercy. For there is still but a moment left for your repentance if you will come to me, Jesus Christ, and confess me as your Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised me from the dead. I have outstretched my arms in grace and mercy to a dying world for an entire age of grace now, and many have made me their Lord, even as many as the Lord our God has called and chosen from before the foundations of the world to be revealed in me, Jesus Christ the mighty Lord: For I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings.
And I have called the chosen, and all who have become faithful in my salvation. Many have been saved! Saved from what, you ask? Saved from the judgment and destruction that is about to be unleashed on this world, its gods, its rulers, its principalities, and all who follow Satan, for he is the god of this world and his judgment has come. Even saved from the great white throne judgment and the lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. Judgment has been passed on the rulers of this present darkness, and it is soon coming to consummation and completion, for the earth will be ruled by my hand in righteousness, for my time has come to be revealed, and the earth is mine and the fullness thereof, even I, Yeshua HaMashiach!
Judgment is coming and is even here but not yet in full. And so many of you still believe you have time to indulge your sins and seek satisfaction for your sinful lusts which come from your corrupted flesh. Understand that I have no desire to judge and condemn any of you, for I have given my life in my love for you and in full payment for your sins in great agony and torment on the cross! For there is not one sin that has not been paid fully by my atoning sacrifice as the perfect Passover. I am the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. And I didn’t come to condemn you, but I am here to save you. The world as you know it is about to change so drastically that you will not recognize what will rise from the ashes, for much of the world is about to go down in flames and perish in a multitude of ways in Yahweh’s righteous judgment. And great horror is coming out of these ashes.
For the prince of this world is judged, and his judgment will be fulfilled and consummated fully. For much evil has Satan done and his ways are deplorable, and he only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. He has corrupted mankind fully and in various ways, and he seeks to destroy all that God loves. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in me should not perish, but have everlasting life. So understand fully that I am the final Passover lamb for all time (there will not be another), and I have paid for all sins. Satan has corrupted the genetics of mankind since the garden of Eden, when he tempted Adam and Eve to accept his putrid fruit and believe his worthless knowledge, for his knowledge brings death to all who eat thereof. And for this reason God Almighty has offered a peace treaty to his creation, even me, Jesus Christ.

For what says the voice of the Ephesians, when Paul wrote them concerning my completed works (for I said in my final breath on the cross, “It is finished”)! But now, in Christ Jesus, you which a while ago were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
For he is our peace, which has made of both one, and has broken down the wall that was a stop between us. Hear my voice. I am your peace, for the law condemned sin in the flesh; even your own flesh and blood is corrupted in sin, even contaminated since Eden. I, Jesus Christ, in my atoning sacrifice on Calvary have broken down the middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile, making them both one new man, even re-created them in righteousness and true holiness for all who accept peace by declaring me as their risen Lord!
But there is more from the Ephesians (as if this isn’t wonderful enough), so Ephesians continues: and hath also put away through his flesh the cause of hatred (that is to say, the law of commandment contained in the law written) for to make of two one new man in himself, so making peace: and to reconcile both unto God in one body through his cross, and slew hatred thereby. Hear me, oh man who has refused my call: I am calling you now in these last seconds, and time is almost up! Accept me as your peace offering, for I am freely offering you salvation and redemption from your corrupted bodies, even eternal life in me, Christ Jesus. Make no mistake: Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
Hear my voice and understand that anything good in your lives, anything of value and virtue, is of the Father and given by the Father of Lights so that you may have fullness of life and come to me, the Lord Jesus, as your personal savior. And that you may know there is life eternal for you if you but accept. Do you hate yourselves so much that you are willing to sacrifice everything you love in life that has been given from the Father to satisfy your own selfish lusts? Are your sins so important to you that you will choose everlasting condemnation with Satan over the goodness of God and newness of life in me, Christ Jesus? Are your sins that important to you?
I am calling you, oh natural man, and I am inviting you to peace and eternal life, a life free from sickness and sin, even a life free of disease and heartbreak, a life free from suffering where you will no longer watch those you love suffer; for the former things will pass away so very soon. There is no more time to satisfy your sins. For so many of you have taken the grace of God in vain and believed the lies of the thief, who wants to steal your very lives from you so you may join him in his eternal punishment. Make no mistake. To reject me, Jesus the Nazarene (even he who gave himself for your sins and salvation), is to reject life and choose eternally the second death of which Satan and his angels are condemned: For they have no forgiveness, and they will have no rest, and they have no peace. And the lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels.
To reject my sacrifice is to reject eternal life and to reject God fully. Therefore, there will be no mercy, grace, love, light, nor peace but only regret, darkness, and torment where you will reap the putrid fruit of your flesh for all eternity. Do you not see how foolish this is? I have paid for your sins in my atoning blood! But you refuse my ways, though I am calling you right now and for many the last time. You refuse my love, though my heart still breaks for you and your families, and I would save you to the uttermost if you only repent and cease from your sins. Do you not understand that I suffered as the lowest sinner in my atoning sacrifice that I might lift you up to God in salvation? For I was lifted up on the cross to save your souls and

THE

reconcile you to the Father, and I have always been sinless, so accept my sinless blood!
For what says Scripture? For surely you have heard that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son: that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. I know these words are familiar to you, for even your entertainers who keep you in bondage to Satan have blasphemously misapplied my words. But you would do well to keep reading, so please hear my voice! For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world through him might be saved. He that believes on him, is not condemned: but he that believes not, is condemned already, because he has not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.
Is my speech not plain enough? Are my words not easily understood? If you reject me, the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of God, you will permanently join my enemy, even those who are responsible for spilling the innocent blood: For to reject me is to join Satan’s rebellion, for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. And so is the truth concerning you, oh natural man, even those of you who would reject my spirit of life, and for all this I am still calling you, though this is the last and final call before judgment begins. For there is no more time. Are your sins that important to you that you would spend eternity in outer darkness and punishment in that great lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels? For God does not desire this punishment for you and has sent me as his peace offering to reconcile you to him by my atoning blood.
Hear my words and accept my peace. To all those who hear these words, know that I, Jesus the Nazarene, am calling you; and I don’t care what sins bind you because I have paid for them all. Understand that taking the mark of the beast will be unforgivable, and I am trying to save you from this temptation (even though the mark is not here just yet); for many will lose their lives in torment for refusing. But understand the following: You cannot get so low that I cannot reach you; only take not the mark. Not even the haughty can elevate themselves in sin so highly that I cannot bring them gently down to salvation and seal them with my spirit that I may exalt them! For I have paid for all sins of mankind for all time, and I left nothing undone. There are so many sins, but I will call some of you specifically by your vices. Know that I will forgive all your sins and not just these, and I will fully cleanse you in my blood from all of your sins.
To the alcoholic and drug addict, I say: Turn to me now in an eternal moment of clarity and hear my words, for if you will listen in faith, my words will bring the glorious light of salvation to you. My words will bind the demons who make you drink and use drugs, though you would make them your friends. I give you miraculous clarity so you can decide which you will have for eternity: Eternal life with me, Jesus Christ, in perfect union with God himself? Or eternal damnation in the fires that are never quenched? Is the sin you greedily hold in your hand, even your alcohol and drug addiction, so important that you would choose to perish, even inflicting your fate on those you love who follow you instead of me?
You are not so low that I cannot lift you up, and I so passionately desire to forgive you, but you have to respond to my voice and come out of your ways in repentance. Pour out your alcohol and quit poisoning yourselves, and come to me in repentance, and I will deliver you. There is no time to waste; don’t ignore me and spiral off into drunkenness and forget my words, for your own words of rejection will be recorded in the heavens as a witness against you on the day of judgment, and you will not escape!
To the murderer, I say: Immediately stop your murderous violence of those who are made in the image

of God, even your fellow man, for this is grave sin. Verily, and truly of an unalterable truth, you have murdered your own selves with every life you have taken, and without me there is no remedy to your coming punishment. But even your murders were paid in full in my sacrifice, for I left nothing undone. I have demonstrated my grace in the life of the great Apostle Paul as a witness of encouragement, oh you murderers.
For even Saul was deceived and headed toward great judgment on the road to Damascus, where I saved him from himself. Paul persecuted, hurt, and consented to and committed murder against my holy Church! For he admits as much in Acts: And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women. Yet he accepted my offer of eternal life and made me, Jesus Christ, his Lord and faithfully served me as an example of repentance to all, and I highly elevated him for his obedience. I have paid for your murderous ways if you will repent from them and come to me in true repentance, for if you do so now, I will receive you in grace and mercy. Do not be deceived; there is no time to waste.
To the lowest of the low, I say: I have even made a way for you to come out of your insanity and confusion, for I have given you over to your vile lusts just as Romans declares: For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.
Come out of your uncleanness, and come out of your worthless pride, and quit blaspheming the sign given to Noah and to every living creature, even the rainbow that shows itself in the rain clouds. The rainbow is for the world to know that God will never destroy the world by water again, though judgment by fire is imminent. Come to me and repent, change your ways and call on my name, confess me as Lord from a heart filled with faith in my resurrection, and I will receive you. Hurry! For you don’t have time to ponder, for judgment is about to be unleashed. There is no time to waste.
Hear my words and come to me, for I have no pleasure in the coming judgment and destruction, and neither does Yahweh, no, not even God Almighty! For Adam was created in the Father’s love and perfection in righteousness and true holiness. God gave him a life complete with nothing lacking. And so Satan attacked the creation and corrupted your very flesh and your very nature so that you go astray from the womb, for sin is in your blood: The life of the flesh is in the blood. Yet God, in his great mercy, for his mercy endures forever, even God Almighty gave me, his only begotten son, as the perfect sacrifice that will save you to the uttermost if you will only come to me in repentance from your sins. I will undo the works of Satan in your lives if you will come to me. Please come, for my arms will not be outstretched much longer!
There is so little time remaining, and Jacob’s trouble is about to break forth across the earth, and men’s hearts will fail them for the severity of what is coming. Satan has prepared many abominations that he will unleash, for to refuse my call is to choose Satan’s kingdom of death and destruction; and I will leave you to your choice, and I will give you the darkness and misery you so love, and you will eat of the fruit of your ways unless you repent. For this is it, this is the last call before judgment swiftly comes. Even my servants and ministers cry to the ends of the earth this very second, except they will cry for your salvation until they are snatched away to me in the clouds when I come for my bride in the air shortly, and this will happen unexpectedly, though I tell you plainly before it happens. And then my last call of grace and mercy will be

73

over. And when I snatch my bride to safety, sudden destruction will break across the earth, and many of you who hear these words will not escape. Some of you foolishly think you can continue to abuse my grace and it will continue indefinitely, but the sad truth is that grace will turn to judgment, and it will happen suddenly, and many will not escape.
For those who are not killed by this sudden destruction soon to be unleashed on Mystery Babylon will find themselves in a world they never dreamed possible, a world where there is constant death and destruction, for Satan will systematically purge anything to do with me, Jesus Christ, and he will do it unmercifully. There will be torment across the land and wanton cruelty, and to come to me during this time of judgment and testing will be the most difficult; but whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, and they will have to endure to the end, and many will lose their heads, and many will die in great torment.
But even then, God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, for John the Revelator declared concerning them: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto the living fountain of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
I, even I, Christ Jesus, the risen and ascended Lord, even the true Messiah: I am calling you, and my hope and expectation is that you will accept my peace offering and come to my salvation that you may live eternally with me in the bosom of the Father! Only refuse not my call, for I will not call much longer, and I will not call in grace and mercy in this manner again, for time is out (though grace and mercy are forever with me). Please come to me that I may save you in these last seconds of grace. For you are no different from those who believed at the start of my age of grace, and my salvation and reward will be yours if you obey my voice right now. Right now is the time of salvation! Repent and come to me in humility. Make me your Lord and know that I am alive forevermore, for God raised me from the dead to die no more. Should you accept my offer, you will have overcome, and you will receive the rewards of the overcomer:
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. Read this again and again, for I am offering you a last shot at salvation by grace. Only do not refuse my call, for there is no more time for such things. For so many of you, rejection of me will be final and permanent, and you will not recover nor escape the coming judgment, for sudden destruction is on you. And the Spirit and the Bride say, come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is thirsty, come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
And finally: He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. So let it be done.
I am calling sinners in the spirit of my love.
I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings.

Hear My Words of Comfort and Hear My Words of Power!
MAY, 8 2024
Hear the words of the Lord, even the words of Yeshua HaMashiach. Come to me, my Bride; come to me in readiness, for I am coming for you. Rest in me, my little ones, and sit at my feet. Hear my words of comfort, and hear my words of power, for I have given you a comforter and in that comforter great power. Hear me and believe my words, humble your pride to hear the voices of my messengers, for they are lowly in heart. I haven’t sent the mighty ones of this world to you; I haven’t sent the ones of great riches and fame to you (though they pretend). No, I have sent you those whom the world has cast away in disdain because they speak for me and my spirit is in them and cannot be removed.
Marvel not that the world hates you, for the world hated me first, and the servant is not greater than his master. If they have hated me, so too have they hated you. But who are you that you should fear what man can do to you? Who are you that you should sit in darkness and trepidation when I have led you to my Father and your Father, even the great eternal God, for there is no other! I, even I, Christ Jesus, have seated you in the heavenlies, and all that are in the heavens eagerly await in great expectation for your soon arrival, my Bride.
For even the great and eternal God, even our Father, even Yahweh himself (who is from eternity to eternity) waits in great expectation for you! For very soon you will appear before his throne in great glory, and in his throne room you will be seated, for you will partake of my throne. The angels excitedly await you as well, my children, for there is joy in their presence when even one sinner repents. For so it is: But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels. Even some of these same angels are ministers for those who will inherit salvation, and that includes you, my Bride. And I, even Christ Jesus, even I am longing for your presence before me. For I love you and long for you, and soon we will be forever united by the marriage of the Lamb. I am your Bridegroom who longs for my Bride, and I am coming for you! I have prepared for you many things, and many treasures and rewards of faithfulness are waiting for you. Soon you will come to your full inheritance in me, and you will have all eternity to realize the greatness and splendor of what I am gathering you to me to accomplish, and what I will make of you, for you are a new creation, a new man, created in me! And you will do many, many things for me, not only in my Kingdom of Righteousness where I will rule the earth in righteousness for a day! But especially in the new heavens and new earth will your greatness shine, and you will forever be with me. For one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a day. I have a question for you, my loves, even I, Jesus Christ, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings! Hear me and consider my words, for the words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Why do you devalue yourselves? I understand you are meek and lowly of heart, and that is from the new nature that I created within you, for natural man is ever prideful. But why do you consider yourselves worthless, asking yourselves why would God even want to deal with you, and why would I offer you salvation when there are better candidates? Why do you sit there in depression, condemning yourselves when you sin? Why not dust yourselves off? (Dust shall be the serpent’s meat.) Get up! Arise! Awake! Yes, you will all sin from morning to sunset. Is this something that Yahweh overlooked in his foreknowledge?

What is it then? Did God forget that you would sin after salvation? God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar! For in his plan of redemption, even his plans concerning me, even the great mystery of God, even all these things were crafted together in grace and mercy; only accept my grace and mercy, for many of you self-flagellate instead.
My children, I paid the price for your sins. When you walk uprightly and honestly and you sin because your flesh is corrupted, just confess the sin to me and cleanse yourselves in my redeeming blood, for I am your redemption and I have redeemed you. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so: whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy. There is nothing you can do to add to my completed works, for what more do perfectly completed works need? When I said on the cross at my last breath in that house of red earth, I was clothed at the time: It is finished, I left nothing undone. And when God accepts a finished, perfect sacrifice, let no one try to add anything; for those are works of vanity, even your subtle pride and your vanity, for on the earth is great vanity. Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher: vanity of vanities, all is vanity. For vanity speaks, and she lies to you, saying that you aren’t good enough and my sacrifice is incomplete.
Therefore, you must do something more to prove your worthiness when you repent before me. Verily I say, fruits meet for repentance are acceptable, but not self-condemnation, not self-loathing, not self-defeating mindsets of depression. For when you engage in these worthless practices of the flesh, you are unknowingly calling the truth a lie and attempting to reconcile your flesh to the spirit. My children, that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would. For by my sacrifice you are reconciled to me, your Lord Jesus Christ, and I have reconciled you to God, for so is the great mystery of God of which you are part. Why do you doubt my words? Tell your flesh to keep quiet, and silence the voices that are contrary to my sound doctrine! For I have prepared you for greatness. I have empowered you in my spirit of sonship whereby you cry, ABBA, Father. I have empowered and enabled you to do great things for me; and above all, I have commissioned you in me, even in my love letters to my Bride. Even the letters I had Paul write to my Church explain this in plain speech for you to understand and believe. For what did I tell my Corinthian Church at the hand of Paul? Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. My children, when you walk in my spirit and stay faithful to my precepts, I am creating you newly in me.
For the old man of red earth is perishing, and both Judean and Gentile alike will be made one new man in me, even by my spirit of sonship, for I will save some of all. Now, if there be any man that hath not the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his. In whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of your inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. So walk in newness of life and understand that very soon my purchased possession will receive in full (you have the down payment of my spirit), and you will be clothed in new bodies, uncorrupted bodies, bodies that are powerful in scope and ability, even houses fit for a king! For you will be kings and priests before our God. So I have reconciled you to God, and there is no more enmity, and I have given you the ministry of reconciliation. Oh, but why would I do such a thing, you may ask? Listen and I will tell you.

And so the Corinthians continues their witness: To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, that be ye reconciled to God. My children, you are my ambassadors, and you hold a very prestigious position, for you represent me. For to be my ambassador is to represent the King of Kings and Lord of Lords to a dying world, and I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. So, please hear me: I have made you my ambassadors. I have reconciled you to God Almighty, even El Shaddai, for his purposes will be done! I have given you the word of reconciliation, even words of eloquence fit for my ambassadors, for the Word of God is from everlasting to everlasting. And I have given every one of you the ministry of reconciliation. This means I have authorized every soul who is born again of my mighty spirit as my powerful ministers, and the enemy fears you greatly and will run from you when you walk in my power, though he will try to whisper false words to you and even roar like a lion. But his putrid mouth has no teeth, for they were broken out by the power of my resurrection, and he will not recover. Ignore that toothless lion, and focus on my voice, even the Words of my Word.
In this great position of authority and power (for you move in my name and my name is greater than all names, and only Yahweh is greater!) I have placed you as my ministers and ambassadors, and I have prepared you and equipped you and clothed you in great power! My children, you do not understand the precepts of my Words, for the apostate shepherds hired the Laodicean ministers to lie to you regarding the power and gift created in you at the new birth. For Paul explained the majesty of the power given in the spirit of sonship created in you. For he told the Corinthians: In spiritual things, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. And again: There are diversities of gifts, verily, yet but one spirit. And yet again: But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man, to profit withal. Do not be ignorant of spiritual matters; understand the difference between a gift and a manifestation, for they are not the same words in the text.
I have given the gift of holy spirit, and in that gift are manifestations. For what does my Word say: But the manifestation of the spirit, is given to every man to profit withall.
Your lukewarm Laodicean ministers have echoed the lies Satan has told through the ages, lies to make you believe that you are powerless, and lies to try and hide your true power in me, for your spirit is Christ in you, the hope of glory! So my manifestations of the spirit are listed as these: word of wisdom, word of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, divers kinds of tongues, the interpretation of tongues. Before we proceed, put down your worldly commentaries and worldly lexicons and worldly concordances, and quit letting them lie to you to redefine scripture to Satan’s ends.
In every spirit in every man is this potential to manifest power from on high! But all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. My children, why would you think these are gifts when scripture says they are manifestations? They have lied to you; read my words and have faith in the words my translators chose, for I was with them. You have all these abilities, and if you will to manifest them, I will work them in you to deliver the captives from Satan’s grip into the glorious light of eternity. Ignore anyone who speaks contrary to these words, and educate yourselves in my Word. Quit worrying about how these things work, for they do not work by way of eloquent words and happy thoughts. They work according to the need, by the desire of the man who must have the will to do my will, and

especially by faith in me. For I will do mighty works by your hands, and I have sent you, my bride, for this is the last commission.
I have given the gift of holy spirit, and in that gift are many other gifts, for what says the Ephesians: But unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith: When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. And again from Romans: For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. So understand that you should think highly of yourselves for you have been re-created in righteousness and true holiness even to show the glory of God himself, even the Father of lights, for you are the lights of the world. But think soberly, for you are not greater than your brothers and sisters who have been born of the same spirit as you: For you all have these abilities, and you all have these gifts.
For I have given gifts unto men: And I gave some apostles: and some prophets: and some evangelists: and some pastors, and teachers: For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. There are many ministries I have given my Bride, and they are yours if you so desire. Ask of me and I will work these ministries in you, but you have to have the desire. So covet earnestly the best gifts: And yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. That more excellent way, my children, is God’s unconquerable love. You should covet earnestly the best gifts, for I have empowered you. But to serve out of the love of God, to give the sacrifices of your lips and praise of your faithful heart in love, is superior. Give freely as you have freely received. Walk in this power because you love God and you love me, Jesus Christ, and give freely of all that has been given to you, and go forth, doubting nothing.
My Bride, so I have I sent you to complete these works, and soon your courses will be finished, and when I gather you to me in the clouds, you will know, just as I knew on the cross, and you will be able to say (as I once said): It is finished. Soon you will enter into the pleasure of your Lord!
I am coming for you very soon.
I am longing for your presence before me.
I am Christ Jesus and I have created you newly in me.
I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. I am he who has given gifts unto men.
I am he who has given you the ministry and words of reconciliation.
I am he who has sent you as my faithful ambassadors.
I am that I am, so tell them I am has sent you.
I AM has sent me to you.
I am he who sends you in this last time.

To My Faithful Ministers: I Commission You!
MAY 6, 2024
To my faithful ministers and to those who have left Laodicea!
My Bride, hear my voice and come to me, that I may yet soothe your wounds and strengthen you in my might. Fear not! My anger is not on you, for I will say to you: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of your lord. For I have harsh words, words of chastisement, for the disobedient; but that particular chastisement is not directed at you because you are faithful, though you should still take heed to my words, lest you fall.
My faithful Bride, you are the apple of my eye, and there is no condemnation toward you, for you are in Christ, and you have built your lives on me, Jesus Christ, even the chief cornerstone that the false builders have rejected. Continue to stay faithful in me, for I am coming to you in great power, for the consummation of the age is at hand. I am sending you in great power and in works you never imagined for yourselves, for you didn’t know you were born into the mystery of God at your first breath, but you have grown mightily in my grace, and you now see. For my grace is a powerful grace that cannot be overcome, and my mercies are from everlasting to everlasting.
Behold! Says Yeshua HaMashiach. Listen to me and inscribe my words on the fleshly tables of your hearts. For I am sending you; yes, I am commissioning you with these words, and those I commission will receive undeniable confirmation of my passionate will. I am sending you in the works of my great ones, works they started many jubilees ago, and those works continue to this day. For the book of Acts is not finished being written until my Bride is with me. Then you will understand the fullness from the books in the heavens, for your individual exploits are inscribed therein, and we will all rejoice at your faithfulness before Yahweh himself, for he rejoices with us and is in you all.
Behold! I send some of you in the ministry of Paul as stewards of my mysteries and as apostles to the nations. Behold! I send some of you in the spirit of Elijah to stand against Jezebel, the false prophetess, and to prophesy for me, Christ Jesus! Behold! I send some of you in the work of Philip the evangelist, where I will take you from place to place with the words of my gospel on your lips, tailored to the needs of the unsaved, for you will save them by preaching the cross! Behold! I send some of you in the work of Peter, for he tended my flock and fed them the pure word of God. For the slothful Laodicean ministers feed my flock junk food, even faithless words of no power. Behold! I have made you teachers so that you may teach and instruct my people in the ways of righteousness, for you will teach them as I lead! For you will shepherd them as I lead! For you will evangelize them as I lead! For my prophets will speak the words I give, unchanged in meaning and heart! For my apostles will shine the light of my glorious good news of the great mystery of God, so the veil of Moses can be removed from your hearts. For the Corinthian witness cries aloud! But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. I, Christ Jesus, remove your veil!

Behold, I send you in these last minutes before your gathering to me at my appearing. I need you to hear my voice and follow my instructions, as you faithfully do, my faithful Bride, for you are faithful! Go not in the work I am sending you in your own understanding. Go not in the work I am sending you in your own power. Go not in the work I am sending you in your own ability. Go not in the work I am sending you in your own strength. Hear my words with your entire heart! For I, even I, Christ Jesus the glorified Lord, say to you: I am your understanding, and I am your power, and I am your strength, and I am your ability: only doubt not!
Do the works I will lead you to accomplish, and care for the people I send you. Will you condescend to men of low estate? Will you sit with, preach to, save, and fellowship with the homeless? For I am sending some of you for that purpose. Will you entreat the Laodicean ministers in humility as one would a Father? For so are my ways. Will you speak the words I give you, even if you don’t fully understand or agree? (Confirm my words with scripture.) For I am sending you to do my will, not your own. Will you shepherd the flock in the healing powers of the fire in your spirit I will kindle in you? (And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.) Do my works, my Bride, and cease from your own works, for there is no more time, and the lamps will soon go out.
Understand, I am sending you in my work, and you will reap great reward if you are faithful, for you already have many treasures laid up in the heavens, and many mansions in my Father’s house are readied for you. For Jacob’s trouble is seven days of seven years, where each year is reckoned a day. So too is the wedding of the Bridegroom to his Bride. For there will be seven days of seven years in the heavens, where each year is reckoned a day, and you will ever be with me, my Bride. Then we ride!
Go your ways and go the way I am leading you. Submit yourselves in love and humility one to another. Tend to my garden, for I have planted a garden of eternal life that the evil one cannot pluck up nor destroy. You will eat from the very tree of life he has failed at keeping you from, and there is no life abundant in Satan’s lake of fire, where he is going, but only punishment, regret, shame, and torment. These things are not for you, my Bride, and the second death has no power on you, for you have gone from death to life in me, even Jesus Christ, your savior and Lord.
So go where I send you, and work with the people I am sending you to, and I am sending to you. For they are not coming to you by accident, but because I have already started directing them to you. Live my mystery and live as they did in Acts, for you are the last chapter that is being written as you live for me, and soon you will see when you are in the heavens once I snatch you away to myself, for you are mine! You are my bride, my glorious Church, whom I will make to myself, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that you should be holy and without blame, for I have cleansed you in my atoning blood!
I am calling you, my Bride, and I am calling you into ministries you never dreamed you could accomplish, for the Laodicean ministers tried to make you sit in darkness. Don’t run from the power I am kindling in you, for the hand of the Lord, even my hand of blessing, is upon you. Do not run from my ministries that I am kindling in your spirit. For I will kindle a great blaze in your spirit, my Bride, a fire that will melt away all things holding you back. Fear not! Walk in my power, for the faithless Laodicean ministers have tried to

convince you that you are powerless, and there is serious consequence for them should they not repent.
Behold! I am sending you into the works where others have failed, and you will go in their stead, for you are faithful: Only destroy your pride, lest you fall victim to evil as they have. Hold not your tongues, for I have loosened them. Speak the words I have given you, and go before me in great power. Do you think I am a respecter of persons? For now is a time of special miracles, as I recorded in Acts: And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. My Bride of great faith, finish for me the works I am calling you to, for we are consummating my purposes in you, and the sun is setting on my age of grace, and soon night will fall fully on the world, for you are leaving. Behold! I, Jesus Christ, will do many mighty miracles, even special miracles by your hand, for this is the final great commissioning for my Church before you are snatched away in glory.
Go, in peace, and I will guide. Know that you will be greatly resisted by friend, family, and foe alike. These are the times of separation when I am pruning the unfaithful and purging my olive tree of their faithless ways, for they have not made themselves ready for the bridegroom, and they will take their places with the foolish virgins. And I am purging my faithful of sin so that they can bring forth new branches that bear much fruit. Fear not, thinking you are unworthy of miracles. For I agree, of your own selves none of you can do miracles; but I will grant many signs, wonders, and miracles at the hands of my faithful. Go and say to the mountains, be removed and cast into the sea, and doubt not but have faith in Yahweh, and Me, Yeshua HaMashiach.
There is no spiritual hammer to swing, so cease from your own efforts. For you can walk on water if you keep your eyes on me and doubt not and look not to the left or the right but stay your eyes on me, and you will not sink. Command the spirits, for they are in subjection to me and therefore are in subjection to you. Command the spirits to depart; don’t ask, but command! Don’t allow them to speak, but silence them; don’t talk with them, for their words are poison; but cast them out into the wilderness where they have no house, and soon they will be cast into the fire. Heal the sick! Speak to the sickness in my name, and tell it to leave; fear not, for I will give you the words. Fear not! You don’t have to speak eloquent words; just speak words of faith that I will inspire your hearts and doubt not.
Behold! Go forth for me, my Bride, doubting nothing. I am inviting you into the works I am finishing, of which many of you are already my fellow laborers. There are still yet souls to save, even the ones whom Satan is trying to hide. I will break them free from his bonds through your many mighty works and exploits that we will do together. Go forth, my Bride, doubting nothing, for I have prepared you your entire lives for these few moments of power and obedience, and you have been well trained by me, and those I have sent to care for your souls.
My faithful Bride, I love you, and you are my joy and rejoicing. I smile over you daily, yet you don’t see me with your own eyes, and you still have faith. I cry over your hurts, though I cry in silence many times. I hear your cries for help, and I am an ever-present help in time of need. I love you and care for you, and you are the apple of my eye, and soon we will be together. I know you are weary, for you have been faithful to my Word and my name, so I will strengthen you in the strength of the unlimited and eternal God, even Yahweh, for there is none like him! Faint not, for even though your flesh may be weary, I will strengthen you in my might, for I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have declared it!

To the Ministers of the Laodicean Church: Hear My Words!
MAY, 6 2024
My Bride and my Church, hear me in my love for you, my children, and incline your ears to my speech. Hear my Words, oh my Laodicean ministers, even you whom I have given gifts. For I have given gifts unto men, and I have given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors, and teachers. I have given these gifts to you for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. For what did I tell my apostles and disciples in the writings of John’s good news: And behold, I will send the promise of my father upon you. But tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.
And in the Acts of my Apostles is recorded the fulfillment of this promise: And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance. And the founding of my Church is so recorded in scripture that you may know the fulfillment of this great promise of good news, that I have filled you with power from on high, even in the new birth, even in me, Christ Jesus your Lord. And I am the head of the body, the Church: I am the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things I might have the preeminence: For it pleased the Father that in ME should all fullness dwell.
My Laodicean ministers, my fullness does not dwell in your churches made in your own images, for I stand at the door and knock! My Laodicean ministers, I didn’t hoard in selfishness all the fullness of the Father that is in me, but I poured out my spirit and made you powerful, and I have sealed you with that holy spirit of promise. Nothing can break that seal, though you can walk away into apostasy if you so choose. But the seal of the Father, even Yahweh the eternal God, cannot be broken; for it is impossible to break the seal of God, and you are sure in me if you are faithful in me, for my promises are yea and amen!
My Laodicean ministers, my gifts to you are neglected by your lukewarm ways, and you have quenched the spirit I have given you, and you refuse to open the gifts I have given you, and you let my gifts remain unopened in apathy and neglect. This is not a small matter to take lightly, for it is grave sin to your account, and you are disobedient to my voice. You don’t respect my words, and you don’t respect or teach my ways. For what did I have Paul pen to the young leader of my then newly planted Church, even Timotheus: Despise not the gift that is in you, which was given you through Prophesy, and with laying on of the hands of an elder. These things exercise, and give yourself to them, that it may be seen how you profit in all things.
Oh, that you had read my words with understanding! Oh, that you would remember my words in faith, but you don’t comprehend and you are faithless! Oh, that you would obey my words, for obedience to me, the Lord Jesus Christ, is obedience to the wellspring of life, and out of your bellies will flow rivers of living water, for I have given you my spirit. But instead of reading my words, you stare at your screens in mindless disobedience; from screen to screen you go, entertained by sin! And you are so foolish to think that mindless disobedience is active faith in me, and you have been deceived. You have neglected the gifts

I have given you, even the new man, and instead have spent time exercising your old-man nature in futility as you seek to satisfy your flesh.
Instead of exercising yourselves in spiritual matters, you in vanity exercise your bodies that are corrupted and perishing, for bodily exercise does profit for but a short season, and your bodies are perishing. For my voice echoes through time since Paul’s letter to Ephesus: Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, for to make in himself, of twain, one new man, so making peace. Hear me, my children, for I love you and care for your souls, even my lukewarm Laodiceans. For you prefer to walk in your old man and his ways, even your corrupted flesh, for you show your flesh all preference. Instead, you should focus your minds and hearts on me and my every word: For man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. For by open-faced obedience to my words (even the Word of God, for I am the Word made flesh and I dwell among you and in you), you walk in the spirit and not the flesh.
For I have told the Corinthian Church the following: But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. My children, my epistles to my Church (even the love letters I sent to my Bride) are the mirror of your true selves, for your true selves are hid in the great mystery of God. By obedience to my words and precepts you will walk in the spirit, and you will give no satisfaction to your corrupted flesh. All scripture is to be respected and learned, but you are a mystery that was hid in God and is now unveiled, and you have to study what I revealed to Paul to understand the new creation I am making you in me, Christ Jesus.
My Laodicean ministers, there is utterly a fault among you. You have lost all respect for my words, and you neglect the gifts I have given you to the point you no longer even heal but turn my congregation over to pharmakeia and the scalpel; for if you were obedient to me, I would grant miracles to be done by your hands. But you respect the words of the apostate shepherds over the words of Yeshua HaMashiach, and my Laodicean congregation pays the price for your disobedience; for you no longer care for them, but instead you let them languish in powerless sin. Apostate shepherds are identified by the words I gave John in his first epistle: Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.
Do you not understand that those controlled by antichrist spirits present another Jesus in place of the true shepherd, even me, Christ Jesus? For these are the enemies of the cross of Christ, and they are against me, and they set themselves in place of me, seeking to usurp my authority, which is impossible. These have infiltrated your churches, your seminaries, your various institutions, and they control your churches by your consent to operating a 501(c)(3), for all under such agreement are muzzled by worldly governments. Your 501(c)(3)’s show your greed for filthy lucre, for you have prostituted yourselves under the ways of Balaam, and you give false words for money so that you can keep for yourselves all the money my little ones gave you in your tax-exempt adultery! You have become a friend of the world, and the world is coming for anything attached to my name once the restrainer is removed. You lack spiritual discernment and you are blind! You lack the care to protect the flock from these ravenous wolves, for you value titles attached to your names, titles I did not give you; yet you covet them. For I have told you to covet earnestly the best

gifts: And yet shew I unto you a more excellent way: a more excellent way which you refuse in your lazy, lukewarm ways.
You no longer preach sin and repentance from sin, but you preach happy-sounding fables that are not of me, and your fables are made up of lying words and lead to false ways; for you are nothing more than a storyteller who tickles the ears of the slothful. I am talking to you, my apostles: for your eyes are dark, and you no longer see my light, and you announce falsehood! I am talking to you my, prophets: for you speak for another Jesus, and you neglect my words, and you do not know me, and you prophesy of a false future! I am talking to you, my evangelists: For you evangelize the nations to false doctrines of devils, and you cause them to drink dirty water, for you fill them with unclean spirits! I am talking to you, my pastors: For you care for your own lusts, and you have made your own belly your god with your self-help philosophical trash; you fool, you cannot heal my sheep with a lying tongue! I am talking to you, my teachers: For you no longer teach the pure words of my gospel, but you teach words of ecumenical compromise, and there is utterly a fault among you all, my Laodicean ministers. You have all the same malady in common: You no longer respect the precepts in my Word, and you no longer respect the individual words in my scripture.
You arrogantly think that you are translators because you can cherry-pick meaning from secular lexicons and secular concordances to suit your ends: Books I did not author, for I author scripture through my prophets, for the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus! Translators who speak only one language, and you have become a laughing stock! Instead, you respect the words of the apostate shepherds, even the worthless tare pretenders. They infiltrated your congregations so they could pretend to be you (for you are the wheat I would gather into my barn if you yet turn to me). But instead they are tares, false brethren who became false ministers who lead you astray. A counterfeit and poisonous plant they are!
These evil ones no longer go out from among my Church that they might be made manifest, but you invite them in and constrain them to sup with you and honor their false words and lying tongues over the words I would give you, even the words of the Living God, even the words of Yahweh! You merchandise my words so you may have all the glory and acclaim that belongs to me, your Lord Jesus Christ. Verily you have your reward, and I will strip your reward and give it to someone who was faithful in your stead. For you won’t even speak for me any longer, and I have to come to my Church as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, for you have shut the door in my face, though I still stand and knock! Utter shame and contempt is on you unless you repent!
Should you ignore my words and not hear my voice, if you continue in your lukewarm ways, I will leave you to Jacob’s trouble; for I said before to you, my Laodiceans, I will spew you out of my mouth unless you repent! And again I stated in regard to that false prophetess Jezebel when I wrote Thyatira, for what did I tell John the Revelator?
Notwithstanding, I have a few things against you, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a Prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication, and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
Have you not read these words? Are you arrogant enough to think that either Yahweh or Yeshua HaMashiach are respecters of persons? Do you think I respect the titles you give yourselves to hang over my people’s heads, as you lord yourselves over God’s heritage?

Reverend this, Bishop that; had you not neglected my gifts, your gift would have made room for you before great men and you wouldn’t need your worthless titles, for I would have honored you and you would have honored me, but you dishonor me! There is utterly a fault among you, and my anger is kindled against you, for you have failed the commissions I have given you and instead have become apostate, even leading my little ones into the ditch where you have pitched your tents. You prefer the unclean waters in your ditch over my pure waters of holy spirit of which all who drink will never thirst again!
You offer unclean, filthy water to my little ones in broken cisterns, and my anger is on you! I will strip your reward from you and give it to another, for as I have said regarding you: Verily, you have your reward. You have your reward of your preferred seats of self honor, and you have your reward of useless titles, and you have your reward of filthy lucre, and you will have the reward of my anger unless you repent and return to me in humility. For the reward of my anger is wrath, and when you present me your wood, hay, and stubble, it will burn to ashes in front of all, and you will be found false ministers!
There is utterly a fault amongst all of you, even you, my apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers! You no longer hold yourselves in saving relationship with me, Jesus Christ, but you have let go of me; for I am the head of the body, and you are to hold me above all else! You CANNOT minister for me if you don’t even know the sound of my voice. You are deaf, and you have permanent ear damage unless you repent, for I will heal your ears from the spirits of slumber so you can hear my voice, for I am speaking to you! Unless you hold me as your head and respect my Words, I will leave you blind and in the ditch with those who led you. You are blind, and you have permanent eye damage unless you repent, for I would heal your eyes from the spirits of slumber so you could read my words and see my face: but yet a little slumber, yet a little folding of the hands.
You have become a laughingstock and a disgrace, for your lukewarm ways profane my holy name. Not only do you not hold me, Christ Jesus, as your head (for if you did, you could speak for me), but you go further into apostasy by profaning my holy words, for I am the Word made flesh! I ask you, have you not read my warnings? For I testify unto every man who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. Are you so foolish, deaf, and blind that you do not understand that I gave that warning not just for the great book of my revealing, Revelation! But that warning applies to all the holy writings! For my Proverbs cry aloud in the streets for all who have ears to hear: All the words of God are pure and clean; for he is a shield unto all them that put their trust in him. Put thou nothing therefore unto his words, lest he reprove you and thou be found a liar.
My Laodicean ministers, who have befriended the world. My Laodicean ministers, who lord themselves over God’s heritage, giving out that you are some great ones. My Laodicean ministers, who have neglected my spirit I have created in you. My Laodicean ministers, who give yourself worthless titles and handles to attach to your names. My Laodicean ministers: Hear my words and answer me, for every tongue will confess!
Who authorized you to change my words, even the Word of the Lord that I have given through my messengers? Your ways, oh you slothful Laodicean ministers, are nothing new, for as soon as my letters were circulated to my newborn Churches recorded in Acts and elsewhere, gnostic sects led by gnostic false

prophets changed my words and rewrote scripture, for they went out from among my Church that all may know that they were apostate shepherds!
You will reap the rewards of their ways, for you have joined yourselves to them, and you live their ways, and you manifest unclean spirits of Jezebel, the false prophetess that you call holy! I see your evil works, and they are recorded in the heavens in perfect detail against you! You are to speak the words I give you, and you are to speak them honestly, with integrity, without changing so much as a word of any prophecy! I am not speaking against myself, for I have told you: Study to shew yourselves approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth justly. Many words have been changed in my writings over the years, and if you will study and respect my words I have given, I will lead you into all truth, for so I have given the comforter.
I will show you, if you will listen to the many voices I have left for you. Follow the texts I gave in Antioch, for they are the voices of many witnesses, and my witnesses do not lie and nor do they disagree. Look to the Textus Receptus and stay clear of apostate Bibles: study to understand! But you, my Laodicean ministers, you do not respect my words, and you change my words to suit your own sordid ends, lecturing my people so that they continue in sin, even leading them deeper into your filthy ways! There is utterly a fault among you, and you do not follow my ways, for you are arrogant and hard-hearted, and I will leave you to destruction of the flesh unless you repent and change your ways. For I, Jesus Christ, have sent these words! Only neglect them not, and repent in sackcloth and ashes. Repent publicly to your congregations and confess your sins to those you led astray, for I will take your candlestick from you. Repent and walk uprightly, and I will return your candle with a newly lighted flame, for it is I who will kindle the fire of my spirit in your soul.
Return to your first love, for you do love me, just not according to knowledge. Balk not at my words, for I am coming sooner than you think, for I come as a thief in the night. Even in your error, you think that a thief in the night is someone who sneaks in a window like a criminal. You fool! Oh, that you understood the ways of the Hebrews. The thief in the night was the high priest who came unannounced to see that his priests were faithful in their temple duties, for some duties went overnight until those duties were finished according to law. Should the high priest find a priest under his watch sleeping on duty, he would toss a hot coal into his garments, so the priest would shake off his flaming garments and run out of the temple naked and ashamed. Don’t be asleep when I come, or you will slump before me naked and ashamed in the worst shame imaginable, for I will be ashamed of you and strip you of all reward. My chastisement is on you and my hand is heavy against you, and unless you repent, you will have great, great trouble that you could have escaped. Repent, that I may still set a place for you at my table, and you will join my Bride in marriage to me, Christ Jesus, the Bridegroom.
I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you.
I am the good shepherd and my sheep hear my voice.
I am the Lamb of God sent for the sins of the world.
I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
I am coming and my reward is with me.
I am he that walks among the seven lampstands and the seven angels.

IN THE WORKS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
Woe to You, Apostate Shepherds!
MAY 4, 2024
Woe to you, apostate shepherds, for you have planted your false churches across the lands, and you do not speak for me, nor did I commission you in the works you took to yourselves. And you have made money your God, for you trust in filthy lucre, and you have taught my people that material gain is godliness. Woe to you, apostate shepherds, for the words of Jeremiah describe you accurately: A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? For your adulteries and fornication are with evil, for you have chosen the Satans as your god, and those worthless princes are no gods. You are false ministers who pose as ministers of righteousness, and no wonder, for Satan masquerades as an angel of light.
Woe to you, apostate shepherds, for you have planted churches who have made my sweet waters of life as bitter wormwood, that you serve to those whom I have called, lukewarm dirty water that is bitter to the belly. Even your bitter waters are served in broken cisterns, and you are powerless, though you boast of great power. You have polluted the lands with false doctrines and built your false churches as spiritual prisons that are corrupted by your government, for you have sold my flock into the hand of the enemy; therefore, come out of her now, my people! Your worthless apostate churches are used as control centers where you will bring death and destruction to those left behind, and you will pay.
You have made Remphan your God. You serve Baal. You sacrifice children to Moloch. You are utterly corrupt. You are wells without water, empty vessels suited for destruction, for your inheritance is burning brimstone, and you will be in that great lake with your father, the Devil. You are false apostles, false prophets, false evangelists, false pastors, and false teachers; and those whom you convert to your pernicious ways are made twice the child of hell as you, for you are of a corruption that utterly corrupts. For Steven foreshadowed of your ways when he spoke of your ancestors, even the tares that plagued Israel, for he said: Yea, ye took up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God Remphan, figures which ye made, to worship them. You apostate shepherds even shamelessly fly the star of Remphan which you ignorantly associate with David, my ancestor; for I, Jesus Christ, am so descended, and I will rule from the throne of David in righteousness. For I am he who is given just such a rule, for I will rule the earth in righteousness!
Woe to you, apostate shepherds, I will repay you to the uttermost for all of your evil speeches, and all of your evil ways will be returned on your own heads for all eternity. For you will join the Devil and his angels in their inheritance from the Most High God; even Yahweh has prepared a great lake of unquenchable fire for you. You have denied salvation to those who searched, but know that I will save them and you will pay. You have denied my spirit to those who would confess my name by giving them false words to speak and silly, vain and repetitive prayers that do not save. Hear me, my people: salvation comes by declaring Jesus as your Lord and believing that God raised me from the dead, and only in a saving relationship with me can you be saved; for I withhold the seal of God from those who confess my name from a faithless heart, for I search the hearts and try the reins.

You arrogantly think because you call me Lord in front of your hijacked congregation that I know you? I will say to you on that day, depart from me, you workers of iniquity, for I never knew you! You teach lies for truth, and you lead those seeking me, the Lord Jesus Christ, astray into a corrupt, foolish gospel, for there is no other gospel: For good news is in me, Christ Jesus! Your vain babblings are about to end, and my wrath is hot on you, and you will not escape. I see every blasphemous action you take; I hear every blasphemous word you speak in my name, for you are a pretender. You pretend that you speak my words, as you pretend I sent you with your pretend stories and your pretend miracles and your pretend staged healings, for you are a pretender!
Woe to you, apostate shepherds, for you steal from those who would come to me, telling them lies that they are required by God to give you money. You ignorantly twist my Holy Scripture, telling those you led astray that they have to tithe to you. For what did I tell Paul when he wrote to those at Corinth: But this I say, He which soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly: and he which soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully. Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. But no, you teach lies for truth and steal from my people, even sending the money you collect for Satan’s purposes, and you will pay, for my anger is red hot on you because you lead people who seek me, Jesus Christ, away from salvation to destruction. But know this, apostate shepherds, you will never pluck not one of these from my hands, for of all whom the Father has given to me, I only lost one, the son of perdition, even Judas, because he chose his own destruction over life in me! Your works and labors are in vain, oh apostate shepherds; you have treasured great judgment and wrath on yourselves. For I spoke of your ancestor’s ways, and you are them which devour widows’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers: YOU shall receive greater damnation!
Woe to you, apostate shepherds, for you have led my people to support world governments that are not of me, though the earth is mine. Oh, you apostate shepherds, you point my people to world leaders who are of the Devil, telling them that they are sent of God. You lead people astray into thinking that I will not bless them unless they bless those who commit genocide on the innocent. But what have I said in scripture concerning you, for this is not new, and many came before you in deception, though you are foolish enough to think you are an original. Hear me, my children, for I am exposing this evil for your sakes. For my scripture says: Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. Your worldly sermons, your worldly practices, your worldly conspiracy with Satan, all will come to an abrupt end, and you will not rise again. But you, my Bride, are mine, and these words are not for you, for you will enter into the pleasure of your Lord, even me, Christ Jesus.
I speak now to the congregations of the apostate churches led by apostate shepherds, even you, my congregation of Laodicea. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would that you were cold or hot. For Paul wrote to Timothy about you and others like you: For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears: And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. So many of you attend these apostate churches under social pressures and to feign effort that you are searching for me, Christ Jesus, which you are surely not.
You desire to be entertained, for entertainment is your desire, and entertainment has become your idol!

And you won’t hear me, Jesus Christ, nor will you listen to any of my messengers except your ears are tickled, but my words do not tickle ears! You apostate congregations: Hear me and hear me well, for I said in the great book of Revelation: And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Come out of her, or you will share in her plagues and judgment, for the time has come. To my Laodiceans: Leave your apostate churches now, for the time is at hand, and I am warning you, though many of you are too lazy to act on my words.
Don’t hesitate at my warning, for what did I give John to write in his second letter? Whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God: he that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed. For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evil deeds. But you Laodiceans are so disobedient that you ignore these words and instead of wishing them God speed, which is bad enough, you go further into evil and invite them into your houses and give them access to your children, and you are utterly at fault before me, so REPENT!
For of a truth, you opened your doors to the world and its ways; you let the wolves in, even the lowest of the low, to feed on my children, and unless you repent, you will pay. Repent or I will come against you, for you are partakers of their evil deeds, and you are in disobedience to me, Christ Jesus, even he who will strip you of your reward and give it to another if you continue to ignore me. For my grace and mercy are about to end, and wrath will abide in its place, though grace and mercy are ever with me, and whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved. For you can have no fellowship with the unfruitful ways of darkness, but you are to reprove them.
But you are so naive to think because someone lies and blasphemously uses my holy name on their unholy works that they are sent by me and speak my words. Hear my words, for by their fruits will you know them! Return to my pure Word of God and learn of me, for you do not know me and my voice is foreign to you, and you have not the Father because you have not the Son. Turn to me in repentance, and I will receive you. Sit in sackcloth and ashes in your hearts and bring yourselves low that I may exalt you! I called you to overcome, and now is your last chance to overcome these apostate shepherds and their evil ways; for I am coming, and I bring great wrath on Secret Babylon.
Time is a luxury you no longer possess. You cannot be lazy any longer, or you will find yourselves in Jacob’s trouble, when I would have set a place for you at my table and wed you as my bride, but you are unfaithfully in the arms of another, even Satan! So come to me so that I may restore you to your reward. It is not enough to hit the exits in disgust; you must repent of this wickedness and change your ways and confess these sins to me, and I will cleanse you in my atoning blood and wipe the stains from you in my perfect purity, for I am clean and my garments as white as the fresh snow. Return to me and forever will you be with me; come out and come to my outstretched arms, for I am here to tell you that you do not have any time to waste.
To my faithful Bride, who have listened to my voice and followed my ways: To you I say, continue in your faithfulness to me, and if any of you have a foot in the door of the Laodicean church, I command you to take it out of the doorway and let the door shut! For you cannot do what your Lord will not! Have you not read my letter to the Laodicean church in Revelation? Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Notice, I

did not say I will come into the Church of Laodicea, but if any man in the Laodicean church hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and sup with him, not his former apostate church, though I am calling them as well if they will only listen. My Bride, the servant is not greater than his master, so follow my ways.
My Bride, I am almost there to catch you away into the heavens, so continue to prepare yourselves and continue to announce my coming. For I have sent many of you in the work of John the Baptist to announce my coming and call for repentance. I have sent many of you in the work of Peter to shepherd and feed the flock. I have sent some of you as stewards of the great mystery of God, in the work of Paul the Apostle (and other stewards of the mystery). I have sent many of you in the work of Philip the Evangelist, so preach the word; be instant in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. I have sent some of you in the work of the Apostle John, who was also a pastor and cared for the flock with love, tenderness, and compassion, even healing the hurts inflicted on my sheep by the evil one. Doubt it not, for I have sent you in their works; for the time is at hand, for I am about to marry my Bride, for I am coming for you, my loves! Finish your courses, for I am near. Time is up.
I am Jesus the Nazarene.
I am he who will rule from the throne of David, for so am I descended.
I am exposing this evil, though Satan wants it to remain secret.
I am warning you, though many of you are too lazy to act on my words.
I am coming, and I bring great wrath on Secret Babylon.
I am clean and my garments as white as the fresh snow.
I am here to tell you that you do not have time to waste.
I am calling, especially you, my Laodicean Church.
I am almost there to catch you away into the heavens.
I am about to marry my Bride.
I am coming for you, my loves!
I am near and I love you dearly; you are at the center of my heart.
I am your hope and salvation, even the Lord of Lords and King of Kings.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach.

IN THE WORKS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
I Have Given You Great Hope!
MAY 3, 2024
Come to me and hear my words, my Bride, for I am here to soothe your souls, comfort your hearts, and make you whole in me, Christ Jesus. Faint not at my words of reproof, for whom I love, I chasten, that your calling and election may be sure in me, the Bridegroom, even Christ Jesus. My children, lean your ears into my voice and hear my words, for I have not called you to judgment and condemnation, but have declared you righteous in me, even your Lord Jesus Christ. Have you not heard what Paul told the Corinthians in his first letter? And now abides faith, hope and love, even these three: but the chiefest of these is love. And so love is the greatest of these three, for Yahweh’s love cannot be conquered. Yahweh’s love is the glue that binds. It is the great motivator, and to give freely as you have freely received is being an imitator of God!
So many of you have lost hope, even your hope in me, Jesus Christ, for I have given you great hope, my children. Understand that the thief would confuse you and lead you astray, but God is not the author of confusion, but of peace as in all the churches of the saints. Satan has endeavored to obfuscate my precepts that I have given in my revelation of the Great Mystery of God to the Apostle Paul these many Jubilees past now. My children, your hope is the very concept that keeps you motivated to endure the many trials and tribulations you have in this life. For without your hope, you would be as Paul declared to the Corinthians: If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. My children, I have given you great hope for your hope, for I have said: you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds, as the dead in Christ will rise first, and you will all be changed, for so will you be like me evermore and so will my Bride be with me forevermore.
For what is your hope in Christ, my children? Is it not the promise of full redemption and restoration, where you will see heaven and the majesty and glory of Yahweh with your own eyes? Is your hope not a future where you will serve me in my kingdom of righteousness, for as you have been faithful over a few things, so I will make you ruler over many things. Is not your hope the promise of eternal life where you will eat from the tree of life and walk the streets of New Jerusalem, where the light of Yahweh and the light of Yeshua HaMashiach will forever shine in glorious brightness? Is your hope not a glory of many crowns and rewards for your faithfulness and love toward me, Christ Jesus? Is not your hope a hope of perfect health, no more sickness nor disease? Is not your hope that I will subject your enemies under your feet and to even make the synagogue of Satan bow at your feet? (For they will know I have loved you!) Is not your hope one of everlasting joy in the presence of Yahweh himself​? For he will make his dwelling among men, and no longer will there be a divided kingdom, but the Kingdom of God only, for there is none greater than Yahweh; no, none can compare to the splendor of the great eternal God, even our Father!
Rejoice in your future, my children, for I have given you a future and a holy purpose in me, your shining Lord! Is not your hope a great hope where you are saved from wrath in me? For yours is even the greatest hope, the hope spoken of by my chosen vessel the Apostle Paul, the very steward of the great Mystery of God? For I revealed to Paul what he wrote to the Colossians: Even the mystery which hath been hid from

ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Yours is a glorious hope fit for a king, for I will make you kings and priests before our God; for I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and there will be no other.
My little ones, fear not the lies of the enemy, for he would exhaust you in futility if only he could; but he has met his match in me and I have defeated him fully, and I am coming to destroy his kingdom, for I was sent to undo the works of the Devil, and so I have sent you! The ancient serpent and all of his kingdom have no hope. They know they are condemned to everlasting destruction and punishment, where they will burn in the hottest flames of blue as they swim in burning brimstone forevermore. They are jealous of you and would give anything to be you, so don’t listen to their words. Hear me, my Bride; Satan will do anything to lead you from your reward in me, Christ Jesus. He will do anything to cloak your hope that I have given you, and so his methods in this category many times are to cheapen the concept through counterfeiting the truth and by way of his lying tongue.
Fear him not, but depart from his lies and keep your true hope in mind, for have you not read? The spirit itself bears witness, with our spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. My children, if only you understood the magnitude of what it means to be a joint heir with Christ, but you will soon know even as you are known. Do you not understand that God has given me all things in heaven and earth, and my inheritance is the greatest inheritance? My children, you simply don’t know your true selves, for your true selves are hidden in me, and when I shall appear, so shall you appear with me in glory!
Fear not, and stay steadfast in your love and faith, for your hope will cause you to walk in great endurance; for what did my hope and joy the Father set before me cause me to accomplish? For Hebrews says: Looking unto Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. Have I not left you an example, and have I not become the type you should follow? Do you not understand? That he that believes in me will not only do the works that I accomplished during my first coming, but greater works than those I did? Because I have gone to the Father and I have empowered you and stand for you with all my might, for I am mighty, for so God has made me in my obedience.
My people, these words should encourage you and give you strength to stand, for I have set great joy before you! Do not believe the enemy’s lies regarding your hope, for he would try to leave you hopeless and trampled underfoot, and even in your infirmities you are made mighty in me, your Lord Jesus Christ! I will now summarize your future, my Bride, so incline your ears to the words of my mouth, for they are words of faith, they are words of love, and my words will rekindle your hope in the truth, for great hope is in the truth I have given you!
First, understand that I have called you; I have saved you in my spirit of power and sonship; I have made you a new creation in me, Christ Jesus! On account of my sacrifice as the perfect Passover, all who believe on me in saving faith proceeding from their hearts will also be saved from wrath in me. My children, understand that these words are too wonderful for most people, for their sins beat them down into guilt,

condemnation, and shame, and this happens because they many times refuse to cleanse themselves in my atoning blood, and they neglect to confess their sins, and they neglect their relationship with me, the prince of peace, for salvation comes from relational faith in me, the great Lord!
So many of you do not understand that I have justified you, and as a result of that justification in me, you are saved from wrath, for I told the Romans: Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. Answer me this, my Bride whom I am coming for, why do you desire the day of the Lord? Why have you listened to Satan’s ministers who costume themselves as my ministers when they say you have to endure Jacob’s trouble and even the great tribulation which occurs during the last half of Daniel’s seventieth week? They lie to you and you believe them. They appeal to your sin nature, telling you that you are worthless when you are the pearl of great price; they tell you that you are worthy of great wrath in me, and they do lie! They tell you that you shouldn’t expect to be delivered from tribulation, and they misquote my holy Word. For of a truth I told Paul the following to instruct Timothy: Persecutions, afflictions which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. And verily, Satan will pursue all who live godly lives, and out of all his persecutions I will deliver you when you turn to me in your troubles and remain faithful in your hope. Understand the difference, for Satan has confused the matter: Satan will persecute all who live godly, and that is persecution; and many times you have to endure his wrath, for in his defeat he has great anger. But fear not his roar, for I instructed Peter, saying: Be sober, and watch: for your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren which are in the world.
Understand, my children, that the wrath to come is not Satan’s wrath but the wrath of God and the wrath of the Lamb intended for Satan. For Satan is a coward who slithered his way all throughout the creation to try and hide himself from the wrath he has treasured, thinking he could defeat Yahweh in such matters; but the Father’s purposes are stated thusly: Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay: lest while you gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. So shall the wheat be gathered in the barn, but the tares and all those who planted and watered them will be cast alive into that great lake of fire and brimstone that my Father has prepared for the Devil and his angels, but no part of God’s wrath is for you, though Satan will try to shield himself behind you and will seek to carry you away captive as spoil. Fear not, for wrath is not for you. I understand many unstable souls wrest this parable, telling you that you will endure wrath with them, but they do so by ignoring scripture’s clear order on the matter, and they endeavor to blind you by misquoting my parable.
Understand that I will snatch you away into the heavens, for I have prepared a place of safety and reward for my Bride; for in my Father’s house will I hide you and there are many mansions. So yes, I will gather you together to me at my appearing, which is about to happen. For I stated to the Thessalonians: For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive, and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

Wherefore, comfort one another with these words. I ask you, my lied-to Bride, will you now reject the lies of Satan and cling to my words and take comfort in them and comfort your brethren? For so it soon shall be, and I long for your presence, for I love you dearly, for I am your Bridegroom.
Once you are taken from the earth, Jacob’s trouble will break across the earth and great destruction will come suddenly, but it is not for you, as you will be taken to the heavens. And then shall you stand before my judgment seat that I may reward you according to your works. And to the faithful is great reward and many crowns, and you will be clothed in a house I have made for you, even a house that will be tailored just to you and will contain your many accomplishments, that I will endue with many abilities, for so is the new body I have waiting for you. No sickness, no pain, no sorrow, and no more curse, my children, for the curse will turn on the heads of the accursed. And so will you be in the heavens for that seven-year period, even Daniel’s seventieth week. And then, you will ride with me as will all the host of heaven, for it is prophesied and so will it be: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
My children, yours is a future of immeasurable glory, and you will never want again, for you have proven yourselves to me, and you require no further testing; so why would you need to endure Jacob’s trouble? For its purpose is to save Jacob, for a remnant shall be saved. But rest assured, those who deny my appearing in their futile efforts to dash your true hope, even those same wayward shepherds, will endure Jacob’s trouble, and they will be saved if they call on my name and are faithful to the end. But they will not have a place at my table, for to deny my appearing is to deny me, the Bridegroom, when I come for my Bride, and I am about to do just that.
Look for the brightness of my appearing! Listen, for you will hear my voice and the mighty trumpet blast of the last trump; for though I am the Lamb of God, I am coming as the Lion of Judah, and all of Satan’s kingdom is gripped in fear of me, Christ Jesus, for their times have come, and the flames are stoked hot for them. But it will not come near you, for I have prepared great reward and great inheritance for you, my Bride. Read my words in the great book of Revelation, for I will show you a glimpse of your future: And round about the Throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and they had on their heads crowns of gold. (and again) And when those beasts give glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sat on the Throne, who lives forever and ever, The four and twenty Elders fall down before him that sat on the Throne, and worship him that lives for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the Throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.
My children, fear not your future, but look to me in great anticipation, for very soon you will be in the heavens casting your crowns before the throne of the most high God!
I am the righteous judge and soon you will receive great reward at my Bema.
I am the Bridegroom to my bride.
I am coming to catch away my Bride!

IN THE WORKS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
I Will Heal Your Faith, Says the Great Lord!
MAY 2, 2024
Behold! I, even I, Christ Jesus the risen Lord and savior of the world, have a question for you, my bride. Will you answer me honestly? Will you be able to provide an answer to me suitable for the record of truth? So, I will ask you: When the son of man comes, suppose ye, that I shall find faith on earth? Obviously this is a rhetorical question, but if you had to stand at my call to answer, what would it be? Would you speak to me of your faith and how marvelous it is? Will you tell me of your positive thoughts, whereby you foolishly think you control the world by your thoughts? Do you not realize that the most basic tenets in my faith, even the faith of Jesus Christ, even those most basic tenets have been counterfeited and redefined as falsehoods? But you foolishly say: “Oh, God would never let that happen!” As to which I ask you, how well do you know God? Are you his counselor? Will you stand forth and command Yahweh? Will you stand forth and command me, Yeshua HaMashiach, to do your bidding? Yet many of you foolishly try to do just that, for you have been deceived in a very grievous manner.
You have allowed false prophets, even the very tares Satan has planted in his false churches (that are not of me), these very same false prophets of whom my brother Jude spoke as I inspired my words in his heart and as I moved his spirit within him in holy inspiration: Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah. These false ones walk openly among you, and many of you follow them, thinking instead you are following me, for they are counterfeit, and they try to mimic my voice so that the naive among my sheep might follow them into great error, of which they are. For what else did Jude say of these worthless ones? These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds, trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame, wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.
I know the counterfeit is convincing to some of you, for some of you do not truly know me but endeavor to worship Yahweh and follow me, your Lord Jesus Christ, via the tenets of the prosperity gospel. Make no mistake: The prosperity gospel is a lie, and I never gave myself as your Passover lamb so you could gather riches to yourselves: For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. Many of you have followed one of many counterfeit gospels, but there is no other gospel. Many of you have followed one of many counterfeit Christs, but there is no other Christ but me, Yeshua HaMashiach. I say to you plainly, you have been deceived, and many of you have traded the true faith of Jesus Christ for a false faith. A false faith and a lying faith where the very word faith (have I not given you the true Word of Faith?) no longer means trust, belief, and steadfastness in Yahweh, your Father, and me, Jesus Christ your Lord, but has been redefined to worthless extremes and fairy tales and occultic magical thinking. You have let the worthless ones lead you astray, and your churches have been infiltrated by satanists, the very tares the evil one planted among you.

These extremes boil down to positive and negative thinking, and you foolishly think that whatever you meditate on long enough will come to pass, as if God had placed his power and favor to those with the most false faith, where you command the elements by your thinking. Do you not understand that all who practice such vanities are caught and ensnared and held captive to their lusts and these falsehoods, even chained to failure, for you are ignorantly following Satan’s ways? Understand it was the fallen angels, yes, the Satans and the watchers who joined them, who taught mankind witchcraft, root cutting, spells, and enchantments; and many evil men have infiltrated my Laodicean church and have carried away many as spoil who have believed their lies.
This has happened because many in my Laodicean church refuse to stand and fight in righteousness so that you may overcome evil with good! Let me help you understand the truth. None of you have any power and ability of yourselves, for it is in your weakness when you finally realize the futility of your own efforts. Then, many times, you understand that when you rely on me, Christ Jesus, and follow my directions in the path I have chosen for you, that you rely on me and my power and have full faith in me. For I will prove to all of you in my own way, when you stay meek to my voice and turn when I tell you to, that in your own efforts and power you are nothing but a grain of sand in the desert, lost with the storms, and I did not die to rescue sand but the red earth of Adam, for I am the last Adam, and I am a life-giving spirit. However, in me Christ Jesus, you are powerful and unstoppable, for you have this treasure in earthen vessels, and I will grant many miracles, signs, wonders and the like at your hands when you have relational faith in me, Jesus Christ, instead of faith in yourselves. Please allow me to lead you, and quit the lies of the fallen ones, for by their actions great wrath is treasured against them in the day of wrath, whereby their end is consumed in fire and burning brimstone.
Understand how this deception was achieved, because in recent Jubilees there was a false enlightenment where those whom your society reckons great rejected God in favor of their own futile reasoning. They even made an idol of reason during their revolution; are you ignorant of history? These wells without water with their corrupted and vain philosophies disallowed God and erroneously taught that God was a mere passive observer who is not really interested in mankind but provides all from afar and allows mankind to figure it out, with God’s favor going to the strongest sorcerer amongst them. Then, over time, many unstable souls, even the very tares of Satan, infiltrated my Laodicean church to consummate their lies in the proper times and season. They infiltrated you with good words and fair speeches and taught the power of magical thinking to my Bride, and many amongst my Body greedily followed them, for their greed was piqued.
These evil sons of Satan stealthily mingled witchcraft into my doctrines and achieved to pollute my holy Word with leaven, except my Word cannot be polluted by their fictions, for their lies stand on lies. Do you not understand that a little leaven leavens the entire lump? Do you not understand that the leaven of Herod and the leaven of the Pharisees are not the only ways of corruption? For you have been enchanted by the leaven of Christian witchcraft! Therefore, REPENT! For what did I tell the Corinthians by the Apostle Paul’s hand? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. Hear my Words! So these brute beasts, these wells without water, even the worthless and toxic tares preached and started their own fake Christian sects, cults even, stealing many of those who would follow them from the true Church, where I care for my Bride in love and grace and mercy, leading them from me into false houses of worship secretly dedicated to Baal, for your nation is

Secret Babylon!
As if this wasn’t bad enough, many powerful and wealthy sorcerers paid much money and spent much effort placing their lies into fake Bibles. They brought out Alexandrian, gnostic texts, causing my Church to become double minded from the single focus of the texts I preserved from Antioch, even certain reference Bibles where these lies were added to the margins. These books were then introduced into your corrupt seminaries and became the default study Bibles for these false prophets who have falsely preached lies ever since, and they will pay to the fullest. Since that time, your lands are filled with false churches led by ravenous wolves, and still so many of my sheep erroneously think they can keep company with wolves. Your fake churches are houses of blasphemy; they are houses of entertainment where they sing praises to Satan right in front of you, and you lack the spiritual discernment to see. There are many lords amongst the Devil’s kingdom, and they sing Lord, Lord to them, except when they say to me Lord, Lord, I will say, Depart from me, you workers of iniquity for I never knew you.
To make matters worse, they took the blasphemous prosperity gospel and further morphed it by introducing self-help psychology, and what have I said regarding such matters: Beware lest any man come and spoil you through philosophy and deceitful vanity, through the traditions of men, and ordinances after the world, and not after Christ. These fake churches are corrupt with no redeeming value, and many are founded by evil builders who are free from me, the chief cornerstone, and all their structures will fall into the shifting sand. These are blasphemous builders and false stone cutters and false bricklayers who have rejected the chief cornerstone, and they have no truth in them! They even flaunt their symbols in your so-called houses of worship, where they mock you openly. Hear the Proverb I have for you, for it is true and will bring true enlightenment to your souls: A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers.
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually, he soweth discord. And so they are and so they do before your very eyes, but you cannot see, for you are blinded in their false doctrines and froward ways.
My children, come out from among them and separate yourselves; for what concord has Christ with Belial. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and utterly separate yourselves from them. For you, my Laodicean church, even you are lukewarm and spineless, and these are not my ways not in the least, for I chased the money changers out of the Temple in my zeal for Yahweh. Return to me, Jesus Christ, the true shepherd and physician of your souls, and learn of me. For positive confessions and worthless positive thinking are not of me, but lies whispered to you by false apostles, even the very ministers of Satan who have transformed themselves into the ministers of righteousness. Run to me, my little ones, for times is up, and you ignorantly think you have all the time in the world, and you have just a short few minutes to repent and return to me in humility that I might still yet set a place for you at my table and that I might still open a door in the heavens for you that you may enter into the pleasure of your Lord!
For many of you think you will be gathered to me when you live these lies and when you eat the filth the false prophets feed you, blasphemously in my name. Know that I didn’t send them and their words are not of me, and if you don’t depart from them, you will have to prove yourselves to me in much trial and testing during Jacob’s trouble, which has come upon the entire world and is about to be unleashed! Look on me in your spirit; focus, for you can sense the birth pangs in your spirit, for I am calling you home and my Bride is

about to be delivered. Behold, I leave with you the letter I sent to you, my Laodiceans, for in these words are illuminated the path to return to me; and if you will but hearken, I will restore your reward to you, and you will sup with me at my table in the heavens that I have prepared for my Bride.
And unto the messenger of the congregation, which is in Laodicea, write: Thus saith (Amen) the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creatures of God. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou were cold or hot. So then because thou art between both, and neither cold nor hot. I will, spew you out of my mouth: because thou art rich and increased with goods, and hast need of nothing, and knowest not how thou art wretched and miserable, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, that thy filthy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou may see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be fervent, therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my seat, even as I overcame and have sat with my Father, in his seat.
Behold!
I am he that walks amongst the seven lampstands, so return to me, lest I take your candlestick from you.
I am the good shepherd who gave himself for the flock.
I am he that will rule the earth from David’s throne and will smite the nations with a rod of iron.
I am he who is worthy to take the book and break the seals.
I am he who commands the angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God, for they will seal my 144,000, even the servants of the living God.
I am he who will stand on Mount Zion with my 144,000, and they will sing a new song that no man can learn.
I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I do come to make war on the kings of the earth, for their time has come.
I am he who is coming for my Bride, for my appearing is at hand. Ready yourselves, my Bride!

Hear Me and Hear Me Well! (Thunder Seven)
MAY 1, 2024
Hear me and hear me well, you false prophets who would pervert my holy Word, for you are not of me, and you have not my holy spirit, and you have attacked my Bride, even my Church whom I have called! Hear and heed my warning, oh, you faithless and crooked and perverse nation, for you will answer for every evil act! Hear my words of warning, those who lead my Church astray, for my wrath is hot against you, for I am the Lamb of God! For many of you will hide yourselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains. And you will say to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?
For the world will see my appearing, and great shaking will come on all, and sudden destruction will overtake the earth as my Bride is snatched away into safety. For I will remove the restrainer, and all evil will be completely unrestrained, and great judgment will be cast down from the heavens, just as it is written in that great book of my revealing, even the book of Revelation! So I declare judgment against you, all who would pollute my Church: your days are numbered, and soon your hearts will fail you when my wrath is revealed. You worthless false prophets who have infiltrated my Church, you have taught syncretized witchcraft and occultism with my holy Word and holy ways, and you will pay.
You have caused my little ones to sin and be taken in great troubles, that I will return to you a hundredfold in my judgment on you. You have redefined words in my holy writings, you have counterfeited my holy writings by rewriting them and changing the words of the Eternal God, even Yahweh’s words, and you will pay for all eternity. You have introduced corrupted texts into my Church in the same way that your worthless ancestors poisoned wells and have poisoned the very foods given for mankind’s sustenance, and you will pay for all eternity. Every idle word you have spoken, every last denomination of filthy lucre you store to your own demise, every evil thought you have ever had, every evil motivation you ever pursued will be presented to you, and you will pay, even to the uttermost farthing; and you will in no way be able to stand before me, and you will take your place in the flames my Father has prepared for the Devil and his angels.
But understand that you are no marvel and there are no surprises in you, for you are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming yourselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their work. For so I have written to Corinth!
You will continue your works filling up your sins to the fullest and filling eternity to the fullest with your own punishment and torment, for my anger is fierce against you, and you will join your fathers in the fire. For you are the tares amongst the wheat, and I will root you out to the uttermost; for my Father, even Yahweh, has declared that you will never have root nor inheritance, for your seed is of the evil one, and you are all murderers and liars. For what did I tell your fathers in Judea these many Jubilees past? You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

Know this, all you who have been born in blasphemy, even the blasphemy against Yahweh as your worthless fathers tried to morph the image of God, of which Adam was created, into abominations made for mankind’s destruction, your days are almost up. For which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers. You will not escape, no matter how far you go into the earth to hide from my wrath; my wrath will find you, for nothing can be hid from my sight, and the earth is mine and the fullness thereof, for I have purchased it in my own blood that your ancestors blasphemously spilled, even sealing your own fate in the fires. Even I, Christ Jesus, the ascended and glorified one, I am coming for you, and you will not escape.
Hear me, oh, you fallen ones, even all of you who pierced me, for you said to yourselves, we have defeated Yahweh and killed his son whom he sent against us to subdue the earth, and we are victorious forever, for Yeshua is dead, and you foolishly rejoiced! You arrogant fools with no understanding! You didn’t understand that God would raise me up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that I should be holden of it. You only bruised my heel, and you are powerless against me, and you understood not that the most high, even your creator, Yahweh, only showed you the worthless mysteries!
For he knew that you would turn on him and his creation and would try to take what he had prepared for me, the Lord Jesus Christ. My meek ones shall inherit the earth, for the earth is mine and the fullness thereof. For you have taught mankind forbidden knowledge; you taught war; you led women astray in beautifying of the eyelids with painted faces to fulfill your lusts on them; you corrupted the Garden of God by planting tares amongst the wheat, and every tare you planted for all time will be rooted out, bound, and cast into the fire with you! For you were defeated when I freely gave myself for the salvation of mankind, and God raised me from the dead to die no more!
But you were so unwise to not understand that I would give my life out of the love of God he created in me, for I am the savior of the world! Yahweh’s love cannot be conquered, for Yahweh is unconquerable, and nowhere in creation is any being like him, for he is the most high, and his brightness and majesty is all powerful from eternity to eternity! For I told you, “this that thou doest do quickly!” You ignorantly and arrogantly did not understand that I allowed myself to be taken by your worthless hirelings who did the dirty deed of slaying the innocent blood! In your haughty ignorance, you failed to realize that I had twelve legions of angels at my command, for at any time I could have stopped you. But how else was the will of Yahweh to come to pass,except by my love and obedience to my Father? For Yahweh’s love can no one overcome! No, not in heaven and not in earth, not in any way and not ever!
You fallen ones, even you princes of this fallen world, you Satans, you will all burn in unquenchable fire for your unholy hatred and your deeply evil ways of disobedience and destruction. As you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it to me. Oh, you fallen watchers, even you disobedient angels who left your first estate, you have no peace! You will be cast into the fire of which you will never depart, and you will utterly burn. All of your abominable unholy tares that you planted by crossing Yahweh’s boundaries in your genetic manipulations between man and angel, between man and beast, between man and sea creatures, between beasts of various kinds, even every abominable thing that you have made will be cast into the fire with you, for you have no peace nor forgiveness!
You have followed the Satans who tried to destroy Yahweh’s creation, even to the point of murdering me,

Jesus Christ, when I willingly gave myself into his hands as the perfect Passover for the world, thereby sealing mankind’s redemption and sealing your fate to eternity in the great fires that can never be quenched! You will utterly pay for all of your sins and abominations, and every evil deed you ever did will be turned on you a hundredfold, for all will be recompensed according to their works. And all your evil ways will be repaid on your own heads many times over, for you thought you could defeat me, and you arrogantly still think you can win when you are utterly defeated.
Hear my words, oh, ancient serpent, for your judgment is upon you and I see your fear, for you fear your future more than anything, oh, you worthless toothless lion! Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, and your times have come. The wrath of God and the wrath of the lamb are about to be unleashed as I will break the seven seals, as seven angels are sent to sound the trumpet judgments, and the seven angels are sent who have the seven last plagues, and they will be unleashed, for in them is filled up the wrath of God. Many woes will overtake you all, as I utterly punish and dismantle your kingdom. Your great king will I defeat and your false prophet will I defeat, and they will be cast alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone; and there they will wait for you to join them, and there will you ever be engulfed in fire and brimstone, and your judgment is about to begin!
My Bride, fear not! My words of judgment are not for you but for your comfort, for I have saved you from the wrath that is about to be unleashed, and I will hide you away in safety and great reward, and forever will you be with me. For I have chosen you, for I have called you, and you are my greatest treasure, and you are Yahweh’s greatest treasure; you are even the pearl of great price, for I have given my all for you. I counsel my Bride to seek discernment and come to me for wisdom, for I will teach you. For some of you have followed some of the ways of these false prophets; only turn back in repentance to your Lord, and I will receive you.
For they have enticed you with Christian witchcraft, and you have believed many lies sold to you, even told you for truth, but they are abominable lies. These wells without water have tried to pull you from me, and that is impossible, so fear not, for I will not be denied! I will continue to free you so that you are free indeed, and I will not be silenced! I fight for you in so many, many ways of which you are unaware. For you were all marked before you were born, for the Father knew you even in your mother’s womb, and he waited on each and every one of you for a length of time that you cannot comprehend, and you have always been at the center of his heart. You were marked at birth, and my angels kept you at my command and have guarded you and protected you, for so are they sent. Does this surprise you? Will you listen to what the Hebrews have to say? But to which of the Angels said he at any time, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them, who shall be heirs of salvation?
My Bride, you are heirs of salvation in me, Jesus Christ. You have been called in me; you have been protected in me and by me; you have been given the chance to hear the preaching of faith regarding me so that you could make me your Lord, and therefore I have sealed you with that holy spirit of promise. Know that the seal cannot be broken, and you are about to be fully redeemed into eternity, for you have no idea of the fullness of the creative work that I am about to consummate in you, my Bride! Know that the fallen ones and their tares are jealous of you, and they hate whatever Yahweh loves, and I will avenge you fully on their heads, for I am the one who will wound that ancient serpent’s head, for it has been declared, and what

Yahweh declares cannot be changed.
Nobody can separate you from me; no amount of evil can break that seal; you are mine and you are the Father’s, for all that the Father gives me I will give back to God that we may be all in all! And he has given me all things in heaven and earth, except in his throne he is greater than I!
And I, Christ Jesus, declare these words to you, and it is I, Jesus Christ, who pronounces judgment on your enemies, and I will bring it to pass to the uttermost farthing. My Bride, my love for you is unquenchable, and I have prepared a place for you, for in my Father’s house are many mansions! So very soon you will be married to me forevermore, and so shall you ever be with me, and you will finally understand the magnitude of your purpose in me that you have been created to fulfill!
For in me, Yahweh has given you a future and a purpose, even the purpose of the ages is about to be revealed to you, for I am coming! And I will not be denied. Look for my appearing. Look for my brightness of my coming, for it is soon to break over the earth as I appear in the clouds with a mighty shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, for I tell you truly that even the angels wait on that trump which is about to sound, and they are at the ready! Be ready for me and look, watch, observe as commanded; for you will soon see me and my glory that the Father has clothed me in, for so will I clothe you, for you will be like me, and you will see me as I am.
I am the Lamb of God!
I am coming to execute wrath on all of Satan’s kingdom, and they will not escape.
I am the savior of the World!
I am Christ Jesus and vengeance is mine and I will repay!
I am the one who will wound the serpent’s head, for God Almighty has declared it! I am about to be revealed in the clouds for my Bride, whom I will snatch away.
I am he who is coming on a white horse.
I am who is called faithful and true, and in righteousness I will judge and make war.
I am coming!

God Is Love!
APRIL 30, 2024
My children, understand your true nature, for yours is the very nature given of God in me, Christ Jesus, for God is love! Yet, God’s love is not the same as man’s love in the same way that God’s ways are not man’s ways, either; but you do learn God’s ways in me, for I am your teacher and shepherd. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son: that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. And in this action of God giving me, Jesus Christ, his only begotten son for the sins of mankind, his love is expressed in perfect union in me. For I am of the Father and of the same nature and same spirit, for God is spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth, for I and my Father are one in spirit, unity, and purpose.
Understand that God’s love is not the same as man’s love, for man’s love tends to be conditional, and fallen man tends to express his love in giving and receiving of favors, and man’s love turns inward to benefit the man who loves, for so is the love of man. The love of God many times is expressed in giving freely for the benefit of another, and to serve your fellow man without recompense at times, and to visit the widows, to heal the sick, to edify the Body of Christ. So I ask you, my children, to learn of me Christ Jesus, for he who has seen me has seen the Father, and though you have not yet seen me with your own eyes, very soon you will.
For blessed is he that has not seen and yet believes, and you have seen me in spirit and in truth, and you have seen me in my ways and by the love I send and through the work my ministers perform for me for your sakes. So you do know me and you have seen me, and when you walk in the spirit of Christ that is born within, you truly are walking in love, for so is my nature that I have given to you, and so is my Father who has given of his nature to me: Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not. And again from the first letter of John: Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
My little children, you are the children of the living God, even Yahweh, for in the same way Yahweh planted a garden eastward in Eden, he has planted the seeds of the spirit of sonship in your very being, for I am his gardener that tends to your souls. For you are re-created in me, and you are created in love, and the love of God is in your very nature. Understand that your full redemption is at the door when you will know even as you are known. My Bride, I have so much to explain to you and to teach to you and to reveal to you about yourselves and for what purposes you have been sanctified to accomplish, for it has been a mystery in the Father’s heart since before creation, and soon you will understand.
So who shall separate you from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, you are more than conquerors in me, Christ Jesus, and my love is being brought to full consummation in you, my Bride, for the times are at hand and soon you will know. My Father’s love is unconquerable, for he is unconquerable, for God is love, and love is Yahweh’s very nature for God is love. One of Satan’s many deceptions he employs to lead you astray is to portray love as weak, noncommitted, self-serving and futile: For these are the ways of natural man.

Truly, Satan is in denial, for it is he that has been made futile, and my Father’s love cannot be conquered, for there is none like him! In me was his love perfected in the flesh, for it was by my love for my Father and for you, my Bride, that I gave myself a sinless ransom; for you are greatly loved. And know that you are the apple of Yahweh’s eye, and you, my Bride, are the apple of my eye, and in love did I ransom you from the hand of the enemy perfectly, with nothing lacking, in my atoning blood. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy!
My children, since God so loves you, then you owe it to yourselves to accept his love and to accept his words regarding you and the mighty deliverance that the Father wrought in my sacrifice as your perfect Passover. So many of you misunderstand the finality of the creation that I have made you in me, Christ Jesus, and in the spirit I have created within you, for that spirit is powerful, and it is love; for it is the Fathers’ very nature, for Yahweh is love. Behold, greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. And I did lay down my life for my friends, and in so doing I have made you my brothers and I have made you sons of God: Behold, what love the Father hath given to us, that we should be called the sons of God: for this cause this world knows you not, because it knows not him.
Hear my Words that I gave John in his first epistle, and hear them well. Yahweh has granted the highest favor for you against the accuser and against those who condemn you, and he has made their accusations baseless against you, for you have been purchased in my sinless blood, and you are acquitted of all charges in my atoning work. Have you not read what I told the Romans these many Jubilees long past? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifies: Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. Have you not heard the testimony of Hebrews, where their voice witnesses of my unchanging priesthood? Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.
Hear these words, and let them sink into the very core of your being, and hear the voice I gave to the Roman church: For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Are these words too wonderful for you? Will you allow yourselves to understand, or will you stop your ears in your worthless traditions and the worthless false testimonies you hold to, given by worthless false prophets designed to lead you astray? Is it too hard of a thing to accept that you have been made the righteousness of God in me, Christ Jesus?
I need you to get really quiet in your mind and heart and let my voice calm your spirit and hear my words. Soften your hearts and demolish your pride; for I have something to tell you that will free you from bondage if you will but believe the specific words I am about to give you yet again. For the voice of the Romans speaks to you as you read, so read and understand; and in understanding, accept the truth of your standing in me, Christ Jesus. And my words are these: There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death. Don’t let your eyes glance at the words, but read each of them slowly and with faith, faith in me, for I have spoken these words over you, my children; and I, Christ Jesus, have freed you from all condemnation in me. Do you not understand that you have been made the righteousness of God? Understand me and hear my voice and give attention to my words: Who is he that condemns you? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the right

hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
My children, I didn’t call you to myself in righteousness and true holiness to condemn you, and you have to understand the truth: You have no right to condemn yourselves, and so many of you do, and your lives are tormented over this self-loathing that the enemy has put on you. Allow me to break these false chains of the enemy, and hear my words and believe them, for they are true, and they are written for you that you may be truly free in me. For I have released you from all condemnation, and the enemy and accuser of the brethren is cast down: Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
Understand, my children, that you are righteous, and to condemn yourselves is to disregard my words that the Father has given you; so do not be faithless, but have great trust in my words, for they are true, and no truer testimony has been given. Understand the difference between self-condemnation and my spirit working in you to convict you of sin; for what did I tell John in his first letter: For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. Do you not understand that my spirit that I have created within each of you, my Bride, actually convicts you of your sins even after you are born again in me, Christ Jesus, your Lord?
Have you not read my testimony recorded in the good news of John regarding the comforter? And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. Of sin, because they believe not on me. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. My children, the comforter convicted you of sin, and you have turned to me, and in the new birth and in the power of the spirit I have created within you, even that spirit of sonship, even Christ in you the hope of glory, I have made you the righteousness of God in me. Therefore, you are no longer convicted of sin, but you are convicted of righteousness when you sin, even when you turn to your old ways, for the serpent loves to lead my people astray and then bring accusation before my Father and before me of his ungodly works, and I am your intercessor.
For again, the witness of John in his first epistle speaks on the subject: My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. My children, I am your advocate, and you are righteous in me, and you are righteous forevermore, for righteousness has been birthed in your very nature. So have a tender heart toward me, and I will show your sins and mistakes to you, even your bad habits and your previous evil ways that you are at times tempted to return. For when your heart convicts you, turn to me and confess your sins, for what saith scripture: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
My children, I have judged you righteous in me, and Yahweh has acquitted you of all charges in me; why will you not allow yourselves to believe my gracious and loving words? For God’s love is expressed in them as well as my love for my Bride and even the entire world, for whoever wills may come, only come before the door closes for time is up. Return to me on a daily basis and cleanse yourselves in my atoning blood, for my sacrifice is perfect and is once and for all: For the Hebrews clearly state concerning me: Who being the

brightness of the glory, and the engraved form of his person, and bearing up all things by his mighty word, hath by himself purged our sins, and sits at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest places. My children, understand that the comforter has also reproved the world of judgment, for the prince of this world has been judged, and his sentence is deserved. But to this very minute he seeks to drag you down into his much deserved condemnation, so he comes to condemn you; so hearken not to his words and repudiate his lies.
My little ones, walk in the love of God in me, Christ Jesus your lord. Love the Father and love me by keeping my commandments, for what says First John? He that saith, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that says he abides in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. I command you, my Bride, to continue to walk as I walked and keep my commandments, for I always did the will of my Father, and so should you endeavor to always do my will, for mine is the will of Yahweh. In keeping my commandments you will have to turn to the brethren, for what says First John? By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous. Hear my voice and follow my words to the end of obedience, and continue to love your brethren and serve in love, not for base gain; for your reward is in my hands, not in the hands of those you serve.
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
I am your teacher and shepherd.
I am of the Father and of the same nature and same spirit.
I am the righteousness of God, and I have made you the righteousness of God.
I am he that is justified in his ways.
I am sinless, and I have justified you in me, Christ Jesus.
I am he who is always and forevermore sanctified, for mine is the Kingdom of God, and I have sanctified you by the spirit of sonship.
I am he who gave his last drop of blood on the cross that I might cleanse you of all sin, for there is no sin in the spirit of sonship I have given you.
I am your intercessor.
I am your advocate.
Stand at the ready, my Bride, for the times of restoration are at hand, and my appearing is nearer than you think.

For the Just Shall Live by Faith!
APRIL 27, 2024
For the just shall live by faith! Awake, and awaken your brethren, my lukewarm Laodicean church, who has forgotten my mysteries; for the hour is late and time is almost up. Come to me, my children, with open arms and an open heart (for my arms and heart are open for you); come to me with a heart that is soft and ready to receive my words. For what did my brother James have to say? Wherefore lay apart all filthiness, and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. My children, be ye followers of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and receive with meekness the engrafted Word, that I have placed in your midst that you may have eyes to see and ears to hear. Turn your hearts to me, for I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father except through me, for so my Father’s will is expressed plainly, and he has made it so.
Why do you let your hearts trouble you, my children? Why do you yet turn away from my words and lead others astray in your error? For you, my Laodicean church, have forgotten who you are in me, Christ Jesus, and you have lost my mysteries, though I entrusted them to you. For I am the Lord who purchased you with my own blood; I am the Lord of Lords and King of Kings who has inherited the earth from my Father, and I will share my inheritance with the faithful and chosen; I will share my inheritance with you, my Bride! So fear not, for though you are poor, you are rich in me, for the Father has given into my hands all things. Oh, Laodicean church, you have become a faithless woman of compromise.
No, you do not care for the meat of my word, and neither do you follow me with your whole heart; have you not read the Proverb? Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the faithless is difficult. And the ways of compromise you have chosen are difficult; your faithless ways are not of me, and you endeavor to walk the path I have given you with one foot in the way and the other in the ditch, and yet you have the audacity to blame me, Yeshua HaMashiach, when in the ditch you fall as you have been led. For your journey has many falls, and my hope for you yet is that your falls are as the falls of the just: For a just man falls seven times and rises up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
I didn’t call you to fall into mischief, my children, not even you, my Laodicean church, for I have not abandoned you to the times of trials just yet. For behold! I still stand at the door and knock because I will in no way partake of your lukewarm, compromising ways, but I am calling you to righteousness. I am calling you to take a stand in righteousness, for the wayward shepherds have conned you, leading you into the ways of Balaam; and many of you prophesy falsely by spirits of Jezebel, who would dilute my true prophets’ words and desire to kill the prophets I have sanctified in me, for it is I who have given gifts unto men. For I have written to Galatia when they stumbled as you stumble: I marvel, that you are so soon removed from him, that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another Gospel: Which is not another. Yes, read that again, for there is no other Gospel and there is no other name given whereby men shall be saved except mine, Jesus Christ. Why are you led astray from me, my little ones? Do I not provide and care for you, for I am the good shepherd who gave his life for the sheep. But the words I have not spoken, that you passionately desire and follow, are tickling your ears; for that sensation has become your first love in your

puffed up ways; for you treasure lies to yourselves as if they were truth, and you have lost all discernment.
Have you forgotten basic church history? Have you been too lazy to learn? Does this topic not tickle your ears enough for you to hear my words and have faith in them? For man shall not live by bread alone but by EVERY word that proceeds from the mouth of God! My church was born on the day of Pentecost and is recorded in Acts for your review. For my church began in Israel, in Judea, though they didn’t understand the words I spoke by Peter on that glorious day when I poured out holy spirit on my chosen, as they spoke with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance! For what did Peter tell the crowd at Jerusalem that day when he prophesied for me? For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. My children, you are those who are far off, for many of you are not of Israel according to the flesh, but I have taken you from the nations in my grace that you should stand in my mercy, for you have been called.
Have you not read? But now in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. But in your compromised houses of worship that you blasphemously dedicate in my name (though I will not enter but stand at the door and knock), you think you have received the law of Moses from me, and in your arrogance you do not understand that Moses was of Israel, and it was to Israel that Torah was given to keep, a charge they failed; for no man is able to keep the law of Moses due to the corruption the serpent caused in your flesh, for his knowledge always corrupts, and the wages of sin is death. For the Corinthians bear witness of my words: Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life. You are called to walk in the spirit, though so many of you erroneously crave the letter of the law, which is not for you, but is fulfilled in me.
Answer me this: Did the spirit come to you by your own fulfillment of Torah? Or did it come by my righteous fulfillment of Torah as your perfect Passover? For what cries the witness of Galatia? This only would I learn of you, received ye the spirit, by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? And again Paul says to the Galatians: I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain. Do you not understand in the beginning of the age there was a Judean church and a Gentile church? Even though my church was birthed in Judea, Paul said to the Galatians and I preserved it there: For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me towards the Gentiles. For the first I sent Peter to the Gentiles, and it is recorded in Acts when I told Peter: What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. For when I sent Peter to Cornelius, the following witness was recorded: And they of the circumcision which believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy Ghost. I ask you this, my Laodiceans, did Cornelius receive salvation by following Torah (for he was a devout man)? Or did he receive the promise through faith? The Corinthians have a voice on the matter when Paul wrote to them: By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. Salvation came by the preaching of faith and not by the letter of the law, for to bring oneself under the law of Moses, even your faith is in vain.
And so Romans declares: But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets. Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. For I told my church in Galatians where Paul obediently wrote: For in Jesus Christ,

112

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by love. And again to Galatia Paul wrote: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. So salvation is not given by the works of the law, nor is your salvation lived and realized by the works of the law. For to the Romans was written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone, and rock of offense: and whosoever believes on him, shall not be ashamed. My children, I am that stumbling stone and rock of offense, for I am Jesus the Nazarene, the very lamb of God, and I have fulfilled the law.
Oh, you of Laodicea, do you think you are the only ones to stumble on this matter? I say not. For you can group my letters loosely in two basic categories, except both are written to one new man in Christ Jesus. For my letters are written to the Gentile churches, and some are addressed to the Judean churches, and thus Peter wrote of the revelation of the
Mystery which I revealed to Paul: As also in all his Epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction.
So your plight is not a new one, for there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. Will you take the path of escape that God has provided you in my grace and mercy to escape those who would rob you of your reward by causing you to fall from grace? Will you reject my words in favor of the Judaizers who ignorantly profess you must keep Torah for your salvation? Are you foolish enough to think that, having begun the law of life in the spirit of Jesus Christ, you are now given over to the law of sin and death? For what of the law? My children, I will tell you. Do not foolishly conclude that I am a false voice leading you into error, for many of you do not know my voice and neither do you know me, though I am calling you! Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one yod or thorn of a yod, shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
I am he who has fulfilled the Mosaic law, and its precepts are kept in obedience to my words of grace and mercy in my epistles and via the faith of Jesus Christ. You ignorantly think because I am the fulfillment of the law that I advocate anyone to break the laws of God, whether Mosaic law or God’s moral laws. For what did I tell those dwelling at Corinth? My Laodicean church, whom I love, you are not the first to deal with this temptation, and thus I had Paul write: Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit gives life. But if the ministration of death written, and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away: How shall not the ministration of the spirit, be rather glorious? Make no mistake, my children, the letter killeth because of the sin in your flesh that is convicted by that same letter, even the Mosaic law: So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good: that sin by the Commandment might become exceeding sinful. And so I had Paul tell the Galatians: I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain. My children, you have been led astray, and I did tell you that new wine must be put into new wineskins, so stand fast in the grace whereby I, Christ Jesus, have made you free.

My children, you cannot violate God’s laws when you walk in the spirit, for it is impossible. You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. And to the Hebrews was stated: For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. In that he saith, a new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away. My children, righteousness does not come by keeping the law, for it is a gift received by faith in me, Christ Jesus. And because you are made righteous in me, you are freed from the law of sin and death.
For it is blasphemous to conclude that walking in the spirit of life is somehow sinful, for anyone who believes such counts my sacrifice for the sins of man an unholy thing. For I am greater than Moses, for Moses himself says: The Lord thy God will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken. Hear my voice, children, and hearken to my speech, for I have not made you lawless, for the sons of Satan are lawless, not the sons of God! For in Romans Paul clearly wrote: There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. And again Romans speaks: To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus. Where is boasting, then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay: but by the Law of faith. Therefore, we conclude, that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. For what have I said: For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
Yet so many of you place undue burdens on one another in that you have believed the prophets of Satan who are sent to snare you into falsely keeping Torah as a requirement of salvation and also to live salvation; and some of you blasphemously say that I fulfilled the law by my sacrifice of myself so that you could now keep Torah. On one hand, you are correct, because to walk in the law of the spirit of life is to keep Torah perfectly by your identification with me; for my church is firmly built in righteousness and true holiness on me, Christ Jesus, the chief cornerstone. You do keep Torah by obedience to the faith that is in me. Why do you choose the voice of the Judaizers over my own holy voice? Why do you place undue burdens on your brethren, for have you not read? For I already told the Colossians: Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any Holy day, or of the New moon, or of the Sabbath days Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.
My children, I do not condemn the law; I only point out the obvious that because of the sin in your flesh you can never keep Torah except by your faith in me, for the just shall live by faith! What is faith in me, you may ask? Faith in me is built on trusting my words and understanding that you are identified with me on every level, for you are my church that I have washed in my own sinless blood; for remission of sins is impossible to achieve by the sacrifice of animals. Have faith in me, for through faith in me is Torah kept, through faith in me the law is fulfilled in you, and you are righteous, justified, and sanctified! When I was raised to newness of life, so too were you raised; and when I was ascended to the right hand of the Father, so too were you seated in the heavenlies. For the Ephesians do witness: But God who is rich in mercy, for

his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved), And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You should understand that the law of Moses is simply not your covenant, for yours is the new covenant ratified in my blood and paid for by my suffering.
So be obedient to the Faith, my people, and be lukewarm no longer. Choose life in me, Jesus Christ, for so were you called. Do the many mighty works I have given you, even in this last minute. I need you to understand that without me, you can do nothing, and you keep all aspects of Torah by faith in me. Furthermore, the sacred-named Judaizers have saturated my church, placing undue burdens on those who seek salvation and those who are mine. My Father gave me a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ should every knee bow. Do you think I would place an undue burden on the nations who speak many languages to use my name, Yeshua HaMashiach, in Hebrew only? Hear me and hear me well, for I am coming, and I will deal with the disobedient and those who would trouble you.
I am Jesus the Nazarene.
I am Jesus Christ.
I am Christ Jesus.
I am Jesucristo – Spanish.
I am Иисус Христос (Iisus Khristos) – Russian.
I am Gesù Cristo – Italian.
I am Ісус Христос (Isus Khrystos) – Ukranian.
I am UJesu Kristu – Zulu.
I am Iesu Keriso – Somoan.
I am Ġesu K.ristu – Maltese.
My name has been translated in all languages, and in all languages has my name been translated, and my name is sacred in all languages always and forevermore! There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Am I, Yeshua HaMashiach, not greater than the stars? I am.

IN THE WORKS OF PAUL THE APOSTLE
Hear the Words of the Lord: The Great Mystery Revealed!
APRIL 24, 2024
Yeshua HaMashiach says to his Bride: Take heed and hear my words, my chosen, and understand my speech, for great is the mystery of Godliness! So many of you have no concept of the great mystery of God, and yet it sets at the very heart and foundation for followers of the Way, both doctrinally and practically: It is the centerpiece of Christianity whereby I have created you in me, and you are a new creation in Christ Jesus, for I, Jesus Christ, have so made you.
For so many of you, the great mystery of God has been lost to time and tradition and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Fear not, my children, and hear my words and hear my speech, for I will explain it to you here in these last few minutes of the age. Understand, my children, that much confusion and many lies have been introduced into my church by ravenous wolves and their false doctrines. They have falsely divided my Word (and Body) via dispensationalism, and this is a huge lie brought about by those who built their houses on sand, and not me, the chief cornerstone, for without me no man can build.
The sand they choose to cornerstone their buildings is corrupt Bibles leading to ecumenical unity for purposes the man of sin has in his heart, purposes of control and death and destruction. The sand they used to build is comprised of corrupted texts, Greek texts that have been passed down from Alexandria. Follow the texts from the Antioch lines, the Byzantine, and these lead to the Textus Receptus, the great enemy of Rome. There are no dispensations, and God is not divided, though I will explain dispensation as it occurs in my epistles. God has dealt with mankind using ages; study to learn. So understand, these divisions are not of me but have been engineered to corrupt my Church from the beginning.
The great mystery has been hid from you, my children, but not concealed, for I revealed it to the Apostle Paul these many Jubilees ago. It is hidden through lies, deceit, erroneous doctrines that are not of me; but it is hidden in plain sight, and the thief would that you never noticed, but it is the elephant in the room. For what frightens Satan the most about my Church is that he knows he is powerless to control you when you walk in my full power and open-face relationship with me. Therefore, since he can’t break the seal of God I have placed on you, and nobody can pluck you from my hands nor my Father’s hands, he would instead try to suffocate you in poverty. Not material poverty; my Church should never have promoted the erroneous prosperity gospel because it is not of me, though many of you believe those lies. Satan desires spiritual poverty for you so that he can hide from you your true selves and entice you to believe you are a powerless doormat, forever destined to turn the other cheek and run like a coward, which is a misapplication of my precepts used to control my sons from walking in their true power. No, I have not sent you to turn the other cheek so that you can be victimized and overcome of evil; I sent you to overcome evil with good and to dismantle the works of the Devil, for so am I sent, and so have I sent you. But understand: vengeance is mine, so do not avenge yourselves, but turn the other cheek when appropriate for the salvation of another and to give place to wrath, for many souls have been saved in this manner.
Understand: they have deceived you with their lies, and they placed these lies that are in opposition to my truth right next to the holy writings. They did so in the margins of study Bibles; they did so using

THE

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

erroneous commentaries; they did this by sleight of hand by misaligned certain Greek definitions that are based in ancient pagan culture and not the truth of God’s Holy Word. You may use these sources at times, but be very careful and stop letting natural man try to explain to you spiritual matters; for natural man cannot discern spiritual matters, for they are foolishness to him. Therefore, know that many of these charlatans who butcher scripture have no faith in the Word of God and are unqualified for the job they gave themselves because they have not the spirit of Christ and are not of me; for if they were of me, I would have led them in the truth. I am he who has sealed you for full redemption in the power of my holy spirit.
The Lord Jesus Christ says to his beloved Bride: I need you to understand your true purpose, and if you do not understand the great mystery as it relates to you, then you will not walk in fullness of power that I have called you to walk in, but you will be diluted in your efforts as many of you have. It pains me and saddens my heart to see that my children do not understand their true selves and have no desire to search. You are always to search my words with all diligence; but false doctrines make many complacent, for there is no nutrition in them. For they are Satan’s lies, but many live on fast food and sugar drinks, and most lack the energy to eat the food that I have given and to drink the drink that I have given, for in so doing you will never hunger or thirst again.
So hear my words, my complacent Bride; it is time to rise to your true calling and do the works I have prepared for you, and know that I will do many miracles by your hands as you walk for me in faith and true knowledge. For what did I say in my ministry to Israel back when I walked openly in Judea? For what is Luke’s account on the matter: And he said unto them, Unto you, it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables. So understand, my apostles were chosen to receive the great mystery of God that I unveiled to them. They wrote it down, and I have protected the writings that you may know the truth of the matter.
Too many of you listen to the Judaizers who would bring you back under Torah. It’s interesting to note that if it wasn’t for the great mystery of God, most of you wouldn’t know of the Torah; for it wasn’t given to the Gentile nations but to ancient Israel to keep, to be their schoolmaster to bring them to me. For I am the fulfillment of the law, and those who zealously cling to Mosaic law seek to glorify their flesh and walk in their own righteousness, and they lack understanding that Torah is kept in full and to the letter by your identification with me. For I am the only one who was able to keep the law, and I, Jesus the Nazarene have fulfilled the law’s righteous requirements. I ratified my accomplishments in my own blood, and I then washed you in the flowing waters of my spirit as you have been baptized into me.
For what did I have Paul tell the Corinthians? For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Judean or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. If you go about to keep the law, you will fail and you will miss your calling, as I have condensed the law into the two great commandments: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like it, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Know, my children, that there are no greater commandments than these, for in these the commandments are kept.
Understand: I explain all of this in the letters I sent to my churches in times past. So understand that I have unveiled the great mystery of God, and the prophets of old diligently searched and inquired of this mystery which they knew of, but it was not given for them to know. I wish you understood that although the cover

of your Bibles says “Holy,” is not holy of its own merit, for it is but the cover of a book. What makes a Bible holy is that the books they bind contain Holy Scripture sent of the spirit to the children of the most High, sent by Yahweh, the great eternal God, for there is none like him. So hear my holy words with your whole soul! For what did Peter have to say for you, my children? Of which salvation the Prophets have inquired, and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
My children, you are unknowingly living the down payment of the glory that should follow, and your full inheritance is about to be revealed to you in me, Christ Jesus, for soon you will be snatched away and fully glorified. So what is this mystery? And where do you find it? I will tell you, for I am the Lord Jesus Christ, who shepherds the flock, and I am the Bridegroom to my Bride, and you are living the great mystery of God, though so many of you walk in darkness in this matter. Fear not, I will give you understanding, and to the wise and humble I will give wisdom. But to those amongst you who will dismiss my words, you do so in opposition to me; and you are either for me or against me, there is no in between. For I counsel you all to learn of me, hear my words and do not dismiss my voice, for I have given you a future and a purpose in me. I am the good Shepherd: the good Shepherd gives his life for the sheep, and my sheep hear my voice, so stop following the hirelings who pretend they are me!
Behold! The spirit says: There are several mysteries within the Great Mystery of God! I will start with the Great Mystery, then I will speak of other mysteries therein. Before we go any further, wipe the dispensationalist fog from your spectacles and open your eyes to see: The Gospels as you know them, the works of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are vital for all. These books show my fulfillment of the law to the letter, with nothing left undone. They reveal me in my coming to Israel. By obedience to the four gospels as they are known, you learn to walk as I walked, for so you are commanded. Nevertheless, they are not the only gospels; no, they are not the only good news concerning me.
For I gave the good news of the Great Mystery of God to the Apostle Paul in his letters to the church, sent from me to him to reveal to you. Will you scoff at this notion? Do you think I preach another gospel and that I am a false voice? Are you so used to following the voices of hirelings that you no longer know my voice? For those who would scoff, you should heed the voice of the Galatians when Paul stated: But I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Paul spoke faithfully the truth I gave him, and yet so many of you dismiss the words I gave him, even lessening the words with sayings like: Oh, that’s just what Paul wrote, or, those are just the Pauline epistles; they aren’t the words of Christ because they’re not in red! You fool! You are in error; open your eyes to my light and truth! I gave Paul the gospel of the mystery. Are you so foolish to believe that there are only four relatively short works containing my Gospel?
Please hear the words of Christ Jesus, my children, for I will teach the willing. For great is the Mystery of Godliness and the gospel therein, for I did announce the good news of the mystery. But I will not leave you with the voice of just one witness; let every word be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses. For the letter I sent to the Romans would like a word with you: Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began. Paul’s good news is the revelation of the mystery kept secret

since the world began, just as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are the good news of my first coming to Israel.
I am the Faithful Lord and my words are true, so lend me your ear and especially your heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness. I ask you to have just the faith of a grain of mustard seed, for that seed will grow mightily in you with the proper care. For what did Paul say to the Corinthians: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. It is plainly written, my children, and needs no explanation, but I will explain a little.
Do you understand these words, my children? Do you understand how precious you are that God has had his eye on you from before the creation of the world, and as he is eternal, and so are you, for you have been in the forefront of his mind since before time, and he has given you eternal life in me, Christ Jesus? Your times and lives are ordained by Yahweh, the great and spectacular God, whose brightness can no flesh behold. Had Satan known the Father’s plans, he never would have crucified me, for in my obedience unto death and in my resurrection was consummated the power that defeated him and he is utterly ruined. He would never want a powerful church who are empowered by my spirit and of whom I do mighty works by their hands.
Does that resonate with you? Stop your mental consternation because my messengers tell you something you don’t want to hear, and overcome your pride, for I will only lead the humble and I will resist the proud. Hear my words and let them sink into the depths of your souls; for I have created you in me, and you are mighty, and you are miraculous; for you are cleansed in my own blood, even the blood of the lamb. For I am the head of my Body who does many mighty works for my people that I am still calling, only hold to your Lord, Yeshua HaMashiach, in singleness of heart and unity of purpose, for I am Lord of Lords.
The faithful witness, and the first begotten from the dead says to his faithful and chosen! There was an ancient church in Ephesus, and to them was the fullness revealed of the Great Mystery of God in a letter sent by Paul from me, for he didn’t speak of himself. I will explain a little, but know that I expect your obedience in faith to me, Jesus the Nazarene, and to whom much is given is much expected. Before I proceed, I want you to consider the following from Colossae, for I sent a letter to the Colossians as well: For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
My children, you died when I died, and you die to yourselves daily by reckoning the old-man nature dead; for you were crucified with me, and in no other place in scripture will you find the mirror of your true selves, for no other section of gospels reveals it except the gospel of the Great Mystery I revealed to my Church. Even though you only see through a glass darkly, that is soon to change, and you will know as you also are known. Submerge yourselves in the Gospel of the Great Mystery of God, for my Laodicean church has lost my mysteries, for most of you seldom read my letters to the Church because the wayward shepherds led you elsewhere looking for words in red. My children, I know you love me, so love me according to knowledge, and walk not in deception.
So I ask you, what does the letter to the Ephesians have to say? For behold, the great mystery is there! Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself, That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one

all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him. I have made known to you the mystery of Yahweh’s will, which he hid in himself, for he needs no counselor. Do not think of the counterfeit definition you learned from false prophets in their worthless margin notes regarding dispensations, for Satan stealthily redefines scriptural concepts to suit his will and plans that come to naught.
This mystery was given to Paul, and he was the steward entrusted with its dispensing to my Church, even to you if you have ears to hear and eyes to see. For the gospel of the Great Mystery was given to Paul, and I commissioned him on the road to Damascus. In the fullness of times, the Father will gather together all things which are in heaven and which are on earth in me, Christ Jesus. There will be no more division, no more separation between God and his children, no more enmity between Jew and Gentile, for you are all born again and are a new creation in me, Christ Jesus. Are these words too wonderful for you? Do my words cause you to bristle against them because you believe the wayward shepherds’ interpretation of them?
Learn of me in humility so that you can understand. Again, in Ephesians Paul wrote the words I gave him: For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you-ward: How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery. Again, don’t get tripped up on the words of the false prophets, as the dispensation of the grace of God was his ministration to the Church, for he (and others) were chosen as stewards of the mysteries of God.
And again: Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit, That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel. Yes, read it correctly and read it again: the Gentiles who believe on my name holy name, even Jesus Christ, are fellow heirs and of the same body as those of Israel who have made me Lord, for there is no difference in me.
And again: Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Yes, you are born again of my spirit, and my spirit permanently dwells in my children, for it is the spirit of sonship, the down payment of your inheritance, and that spirit embodies all of the abilities I have given you, for I have given gifts unto men. You are fashioned in my image, and you are created newly in me; for the Father has begotten you in me, for I am a life-quickening spirit.
Christ Jesus the ascended says: My little children, take great comfort in me, for my salvation, once achieved by making me your Lord in faith and repentance, cannot be lost or undone; for which of you can undo the natural creation of your traits in your own children, though they may lose inheritance if you were to disown them. Salvation is a gift given by my Father through me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Now, I will give you breadcrumbs to follow on your journey into the mysteries contained within the great Mystery of God, so study to show yourselves approved to God, a workman of the Word, rightly dividing the word of truth, that you may not be ashamed before me at my coming.
There is the mystery in Romans, considering Israel’s blindness in part. There is the mystery of the gathering

of my bride, which some call rapture, and that is in Corinthians (and elsewhere); for in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the last trump shall sound, and its sounding is upon you. Then there is the mystery of a husband and wife becoming one flesh, and this is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church, and you may find that in Ephesians. For I will take blindness from Israel when they turn their hearts to me. For I will gather my Bride to me, for I am the Bridegroom. I am he to whom you will be married, that we may forever be one in me and in my Father, for God is all in all. My heart rests on you, my children, and soon you will see me face to face; and make no mistake, I am calling you to me, my wise virgins, and I am coming for you so very soon, and I long to see you all where we will be face to face, and you will know, even as you are known.
I am he who has sealed you for full redemption in the power of my holy spirit. I am the fulfillment of the law.
I am the Lord Jesus Christ who shepherds the flock.
I am the Bridegroom to my Bride and you are living the great mystery of God.

Hear Me in My Love for You, My Children!
APRIL 21, 2024
(In context of the prophetic message, “Edomite” is referring to those who adopted the Canaanite ways of genetic manipulation, black magic, sacrificing children, cannibalism, and so forth. Esau actually married two Hittite women, which are Canaanites, and he took a third wife from Ishmael’s house. Esau’s marrying Canaanite women indicates disobedience and compromise as well as potential genetic pollution, since Canaan had tampered with genetics somehow. The term Edomite is applied in this context to those who still practice these satanic rites, and the title could fit any ethnic group or nation that fits the bill. King Herod was an Edomite, and so were many of the Pharisees, and Jesus called them sons of the Devil, which indicates seed. Take note, though, the term Edomite as used in this message has no reference to any person based on race or nationality of their own merits. It is an identifier used to call out those who secretly practice Canaanite occultism or who have descended from those bloodlines and are dispersed across the nations. – William Brooks)
Hear my words, my Church, and incline your ears to wisdom and truth, for behold: My words are wisdom and truth. Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, and understanding seeks a discourse with you; will you now lend me your ear in willful obedience? For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am crying aloud to be heard of my Bride, even all those in the body of Christ. Hear my words, says the great and faithful Lord, even he whose kingdom is not of the world, for my kingdom is the kingdom of heaven. So in my kingdom, so as it is in heaven, so shall it be on the earth; for I will bring righteousness to the earth, and no evil thing shall enter my gates, for my kingdom is a kingdom of righteousness where the lion shall lie down with the lamb in peace and safety. So many of you, my Bride, have become haughty in these days of increased knowledge, and this is not unexpected, for what saith my Word: For knowledge puffeth up! But love edifies. Now hear me in my love for you, my children!
Hear my words, for I will speak about the Edomites among you, for many of you do not know to whom I refer. I will speak of those who dress in sheep’s clothing but are ravenous wolves, for they disguise themselves and walk among you. I will speak of the synagogue of Satan and all those who have infiltrated my Father’s creation, sent by Satan himself, for they are the very seed of the serpent. Oh, wait, don’t stop your ears and cover your eyes because you disagree with my words, oh, my willingly blind and deaf little ones, but bend your knees in humility and bow your ear to my words, for pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.
Know, my little ones, that the words in my Word of God are true, accurate, and reliable: even if you don’t understand these words and try to rationalize away the literal truth, saying to yourselves: Oh, that’s not literal but figurative. Oh, that’s not written to me but to someone else. Oh, those are just ancient myths and literary devices. Oh, those are just stories of times past and shouldn’t be taken literally. You fool! You allow the wayward shepherds to say that the very Word of God, the same words by which comes your salvation, the words of Yahweh himself aren’t true but can be faithlessly explained away? Oh, depart from your faithless ways, my people, and come to me with an open heart and a mind that is clothed in humility.

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

Have you not read? What does Genesis say on the matter when Yahweh confronted the serpent for his crafty vileness he accomplished in the Garden these many Jubilees now past? And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: it shall bruise your head, and you shalt bruise his heel. Do you think these words are make believe and figurative, my children? Do you believe the faithless words of the enlightenment that has blinded your minds to my words all this time now? Lies that are accepted in your sciences, for they are made spurious by their lies. Lies that are accepted into your cosmology, for they are made spurious by their lies. Lies that are accepted into your history, for you have forgotten who you are, my little ones, and you have been disconnected from your true past and live the lies of the enemy in utter ignorance of the real world in which you live.
Just as surely as I am the promised seed of the woman, yes, that wonderful woman in scripture (who some sinfully worship) who said, Be it unto me according to your will, by whom I came into this world. I was born even of Mary in Bethlehem of Judea and raised as the son of a carpenter, raised by Joseph who was of the lineage of David, when he did not want to make a public spectacle of her (for he loved her greatly), for she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. Just as I am the promised seed sent by God, so too Satan has a seed. Not that he can create anything of himself, for he is a leech and a thief, but he has made abominations for your destruction.
Why is this so hard for you to believe? Listening to lies passed for truth, you have dismissed the most elementary things, for I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not: how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? Have you not read the words of Yahweh to his faithful servant Job? Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Read that last part again, my children, “the sons of God shouted for joy” – yes, the angels were present at creation, and they are wise to many of the secrets of heaven that are not for mankind to know, for mankind has searched for years in his lusts for power and glory.
This is fallen-angel knowledge, my children, have you not read? Or do you still believe the lies of the Edomites that they have sown among you? But what does Genesis say on the matter? There were giants in the earth in those days: and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them; the same became mighty men, which were of old, men of renown. So many of you exhaust my patience believing the erroneous fable that the sons of God were from Seth, and they married evil daughters of men and produced giants in wickedness. Mankind has been wicked since the fall, and no matter how many evil people procreate, their offspring will not be extremely large giants. No. That is a fable meant to deceive, for part of Satan’s success is due to his dishonest secrecy, and he is defeated, so his temporary success has ended in utter failure and he will not escape his lake. Fear him not, but understand the words of my Word in their biblical context, and be not unwise and ignorant of the truth.
The sons of God are the watchers in this context, angels who were charged to help mankind but instead left their first estate, for they lusted after the daughters of men. For what did I tell Jude to announce on my behalf? And the Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day. Read it again and be not faithless, but only believe. The sons of God are fallen angels who defiled themselves with women; many of these

women were taken and were abused, though some of them did so voluntarily and they will bear their judgment.
The offspring they produced in their defilement, yes, this unholy union produced giants, evil creations made for your destruction. You do yourself great disservice by narrowly relying on your 66 book canon only. There are many canons and your 66 book Protestant canon does not contain all the prophecies ever given but contains all things pertaining to life and godliness in me Christ Jesus. Read the books of 1 Enoch and Jasher and Jubilees. They are not scripture to you but are certainly recommended reading suggested and quoted in the very scriptures you love. Don’t be controlled by thinking that only books allowed in a particular canon are all the prophecies ever given. Learn of me.
Yet, God destroyed the world that then was, for what says my friend Peter: For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water, and in the water, Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished. And in the days of Noah my Father sent the great deluge that wiped out all their evil abominations, for they made many abominations that brought great destruction on the earth. They violated the natural order of life and introduced instability into the very DNA of mankind, and man was crossed with beast and beast was crossed with fish and one type of beast was bred with another type of beast until the desired abominations were achieved. Then the abominations destroyed mankind. and so my Father destroyed them, saving eight souls alive. Noah found favor in God’s sight, and Noah and his family were all that were not corrupted on the earth in their genetic tamperings, for Noah was a righteous man.
Read my words and understand your world, for many of you believe the lies of the false enlightenment that disallowed anything of a spiritual nature and served to dumb down the masses to their faithless lies that earthly matter is the only thing relevant. Do you not understand, they disallowed God in their faithless ramblings? They have deceived you on purpose with learning against learning: study to understand this doctrine of Jesuits.
But what says Genesis on the matter? There were Giants in the earth in those days: and also after that.
After what days, you ask? After the days of Noah. For after the flood the earth was divided by lot of inheritance, and in the days of Peleg was the earth divided by inheritance amongst Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth. For our purposes we will follow the line of Ham, for from Ham came the bloodlines of the accursed, even Nimrod from Cush and Egypt or Mizraim, and the evil Canaanites descended from the evil Canaan. For it was Canaan that Noah cursed. For Canaan left his inheritance and founded the city of Tyre on what became the Phoenician coast and led to Sidon of which Jezebel descended. He did this so that he could be in proximity to Mount Hermon, where the watchers descended and where I was transfigured.
Canaan found what the watchers left behind, and he used their fallen-angel knowledge in great sorceries, and many vile rights were done by the Canaanite, for they even sacrificed their own children. So vile were they and so pervasive that he managed to infect the land of Canaan with his newly made abominations, where Satan worked on account of his transgressions. So as my Father brought the Hebrews out of captivity from Egypt, so he commissioned them to take their inheritance away from these abominable tribes of giants. (Do you still not believe my Words?) Have you not read the evil report given by ten of the twelve spies sent into the land of Canaan by Moses to spy it out? For only Joshua and Caleb spoke words of faith, but the evil report given was literally true, except it was a sinful, faithless report that denied my Father’s

124

THE

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

words in favor of what they saw with their eyes, for God is greater than anyone’s eyes, my little ones. Read the report in Deuteronomy: But the men that went up with him, said, We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched, unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone, to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it, are men of a great stature. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
So Joshua cleansed the land of these evil abominations, and they were not what you would call human; they were hybrid abominations made for the destruction of the Christ line, as Satan so desired to stop my first coming. Yet, the children of Israel did not faithfully carry out the task my Father gave them in claiming their inheritance from violent usurpers. Many of these creatures were cannibals; did you not just read where the land ate the inhabitants thereof? For what does Judges tell us on the matter: And the Lord was with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
And Judges says yet again: Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean, and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor, and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam, and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo, and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out. For what says Numbers on this account: But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them, shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
And so scripture was fulfilled and the Canaanite tribes still vex God’s children to this day. The have commingled themselves amongst God’s creation and have hidden themselves in plain sight, even taking the culture and mannerisms of their host nations. But the end is the same every time: They purposely destroy their host nations (God has made them fugitives and vagabonds in the earth). They have spoken great lies and sold those very same lies for truth. They have overtaken your lands, and you do not even see them, for you are blinded to their ways because many of you have compromised with them, even the synagogue of Satan.
Return to my pure Word and ignore the words and ways of the Edomites. Cease to elevate sinful words above my Father’s most Holy Word. For many of these Canaanites became Idumeans over time and lived in proximity to Judah. When John Hyrcanus conquered Idumea, he converted the Idumeans to Judaism, and Judea was born from the combination of Judah and Idumea. And thus I stood against them in Israel some 2000 years ago, and my stand is recorded in the gospels that you may walk as I walked. Their eords perverted the Torah, and their oral traditions and occultic rituals from Babylon hid themselves in my land, for my land has been taken by imposters, the very Synagogue of Satan.
Ever since Genesis 3:15 there has been a seed war between God and Satan and Satan’s own seed battles for supremacy, which he shall not have. I have won the victory, my children, and I have empowered you, my children, against all manner of evil, and nothing shall by any means stop you; for I, Jesus Christ, have defeated the enemy’s kingdom. Stand against them and stop promoting their evil ways. Come out from among them because they have made themselves to look just like you. Do you not believe my parable of the

wheat and tares? Another parable put he forth unto them, saying; The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. Come out from among them and separate yourselves from the synagogue of Satan who say they are Judeans but do lie and are not. For Israel has been scattered amongst the Gentiles, and I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; thus the times of the Gentiles is nearly completed, and I have made of two, one new man in me, so making peace.
My children, I give you a brief overview of your history, for mankind’s history traces from Noah to Adam, and God has made of one blood all nations. My children, time is almost up, but that doesn’t mean your work is done. I am still calling my children to stand for me and to minister for me. For I have made you able ministers of the New Testament in my blood. Have you not read where I told my followers that if they will say unto this mountain be removed and cast in the sea, and that if they doubt not, they will have the things they command? I counsel you to back up one verse, for that narrative begins with have faith in God (for with God nothing shall be impossible) and you can do nothing without me, my little ones.
So many of you have been taught by the Edomites lies that lead you into their ways. But if you have faith in God, you will command the impossible, and you will need to do just that in the work I am sending you. I am sending you, my children, to gather the sheep that remain, for many will come to me in these last minutes and I will not deny them, but I passionately search for them still. Open your mouths in faith and stand for me and minister to my children.
I have told you how to wield my power, but you refuse my instruction, so I will tell the forgetful among you once again. Why do you sheepishly ask a spirit to leave its host with stuttering lips and using my name, Jesus Christ, in a faithless manner? Do not use my name in vain! Command the spirits in my name with great faith and have faith in the words that I will give you, and the evil spirits will depart by my power through you!
Why do you timidly ask sickness to leave when you should speak to the sickness in confidence in my name and command the impossible in my name and heal the sick. Say to that mountain, be removed and cast into the sea, heal the sick, cast out the spirits, raise the dead and command the impossible, for so have I enabled you.
Have you not read that the first shall be last, and the last shall be first? Know, my children, that I am moving in greater power than I did in the first century, and I have poured out my spirit in full measure across the earth. Which of you has the courage to stand for me? To speak for me the words that I give you? Which of you has the faith to not shrink from an evil report but hit the evil head on? For greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Do not be subservient to the Canaanite, for they are cursed to be subservient to you. Furthermore, do not get caught up on national genealogies, for I am sent to all nations that I may save some, and in so doing, I am saving the true Israel, for she is cast out among the nations, and you all are the true Israel of God!
Stand for me and speak for me, for time is almost up. Will you be one of the ones who approach my judgment seat having gathered wood, hay, and stubble against that great approaching day? Or will you present me gold, silver, and precious stones, for my people are my treasure. Set the captives free and work with me in these final minutes. And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was

manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
My children, I am the Word made flesh, and I and my Father are one. In the same manner, become one with us by your obedience to me, for very soon you will be like me and be received up into glory, for I am the firstfruits from among the dead, and I will present you a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. Time is almost out, so do not hesitate. Work with me in these final minutes, and do not hesitate to open your mouths. I will bring them to you, so do my works and cease from your own. I will do many mighty works by your hands, only doubt not!
I am the promised seed of the woman.
I am the promised seed sent by God.
I am still calling my children to stand for me and to minister for me. I am sending you, my children, to gather the sheep that remain.
I am saving the true Israel, for she is cast out among the nations, and you all are the true Israel of God!
I am sent to all nations that I may save some.
I am the Word made flesh and me and my Father are one.
I am the firstfruits from among the dead.

For God Is Not the Author of Confusion!
APRIL, 20, 2024
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints! Read these words and hearken to my voice. Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. Perhaps you should follow my example from the garden as I prayed in agony when I fell on the ground before my Father in prayer and humility, and he strengthened me to accept the cup of wrath of your very own sins that I took on myself for you, for I am able to bear them. I speak to the haughty ones in my Church, and I speak to the many divisions amongst you. But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Is it not written to the letter I sent to followers of the Way at Rome? But what saith Zechariah on the matter: But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. Have you not read Isaiah, my little ones? For what saith the prophets of old? For Isaiah says again, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.
My children, I have shown you a more excellent way, but many of you are fallen from grace and your arrogant pride has caused you to elevate yourselves above measure. Yet, my words I gave to the Apostle Paul for Galatia plainly state: For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. My little children, I know you are eager in heart to serve me, and I know you love me, just at times not according to knowledge. Do you not understand that God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble? Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. Likewise, you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. Don’t consider my words repetitive, for in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established. Understand, my children, you cannot serve me with your flesh: For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. My Church, submit yourselves one to another in a mind clothed in humility, for I might be the one giving the words to say and the inspiration to teach you, though many of you will set the voice of the humble aside in favor of someone’s reputation and person. Be followers of God, my children, for of a truth God is no respecter of persons.
Behold! It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of Kings is to search out a matter. Understand that I will make you kings and priests before our God and our Father, so understand the sayings of the wise among you: has not God given you two ears and one mouth? Have you not read? Every one of you has a Psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation: Let all things be done unto edifying! But no, you bite and devour one another in your arrogance; in your pride you attack those who try to teach you, and you have become unteachable. You argue, bicker, debate, and fight one another instead of humble consideration of what the other says. On the other side, are you so prideful to think that because the words come out of your lips that they are true because YOU said them? Submit yourselves one to another. Hold your tongue and take the words of your brethren to scripture to prove all things and hold fast to the good. Unstop your ears and listen fully and consider, for in so doing I will make you wise in your humility, so be not wise in your own conceits. I counsel everyone among you, hear

my words. And what do those words say? For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
No, stop, consider the words I just gave you, open your Bibles and read these words again. Hear them and believe them, for you owe it to yourself to think highly of yourselves, for I have raised you up together and made you sit together in heavenly places in me, Christ Jesus. But at the same time you should think soberly, for God has given to every man among you the same measure of faith, so the spirit given is not greater or less in your brethren, but to every one of you is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith: When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men. I have given some apostles: and some prophets: and some evangelists: and some pastors, and teachers: For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Submit to one another and drop your worthless pride as it causes factions among you. Why do you not understand that there should be no divisions among you, my children. Is the body of Christ divided? What have I said to the Corinthians?
Now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment. Are you not all one in me, the Lord Jesus Christ? Yet you have so many factions among you, and you bite and devour each other for the tiniest disagreements. Know that in your factions and backbiting you amuse Satan, and he brags on your utter futility of effort spent fighting among yourselves because many of you lack humility. And your ears are stopped up so you cannot hear each other’s voices, and you have closed your eyes, and they are glued shut in pride and unbelief, for so many of you think you have the all truth. And you discount the words of your brethren, and you discount the very words that I have given them for you, and in your arrogant pride you lack the basic humility to hear and consider. For if a man heareth not a thing, it is folly and shame to him. And again, why do you set at naught your brethren, for we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ? I counsel you, my Church, to repudiate your pride and haughty ways and come to me as a student of the Word of life, for I am the Word of God made flesh.
So listen with your full soul and give heed to the sounds of your ears and perceive my words. So understand the order of events given in my Word, for many of you are deceived by ravenous wolves that you ignorantly follow, for you have listened to the wayward shepherds. Who are you to preach that there is no gathering together of my Church to me, that I will not meet my Church in the air when I come with a mighty shout and the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God? For the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and you which are alive and remain will not precede them, and you will all be caught up in the clouds to meet me and forevermore will you be with me. Are these words too good for you to believe? Or will you believe the words of the Judaizing wayward shepherds over the voice of your Lord and savior, Christ Jesus? Why do you not have faith in my Word nor in the very words that comprise my Word? Do you not understand what a biblical mystery is or its purpose?
I will tell you: A mystery is a thing kept secret but prophesied of that is revealed at the proper time. And why would the Father do such a thing, you ask? Have you not read my report? But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord

of glory. Who are you to discount my Father’s plans and ways? For he needs no counselor, though ten thousand times ten thousand surround his throne.
So comfort yourselves together with my words, for you are saved from wrath in me. Then, in your faithless ways, you argue over the timing of this event. Even though some of you erroneously say there is no gathering, many of you debate the timing of its occurrence in relation to Jacob’s trouble. I will make it plain for you if you will listen, though many of you will stubbornly deny this event, even denying me and absolutely sealing your destiny to take your place amongst the unwise virgins. For what says my Word?
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our assembling unto him, That ye be not suddenly moved from your mind, nor troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter, as it were from us, as though the day of Christ were at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a departing first, and that that man of sin be disclosed, even the son of perdition. (Look to the Byzantine, my children, for many corrupt Bibles have come from gnostic texts, fake texts given by sinful men. Do you not understand the difference between a biblical text and a Bible version?) There will be a falling away from the faith in apostasy, and those who refuse to depart from the faith will depart from the earth to meet me in the air.
For herein is the parable of the ten virgins. Five wise virgins purchased oil and trimmed their wicks and were ready when the bridegroom arrived, and five were not ready and neglected to buy oil, trying instead to take from the needs of others. The five prepared virgins continued with the bridegroom, and the five unwise asked to be let in afterwards and were told, depart from me, I never knew you. Quench not my spirit in you that would verify these words. Understand the son of perdition cannot come into power and Satan’s full kingdom cannot rise from the abyss until the restrainer is removed, and since you are saved from wrath, the restrainer will be removed when I gather my Bride to myself in the clouds when she meets me in the air.
Then at the end of the seven years of Jacob’s trouble comes the resurrection of the just. Behold! And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
Do you still not believe my words? Verily, many of you will stubbornly cling to your error and the words of the wayward shepherds, and many of you who could have escaped the wrath of God that comes to try the earth during Jacob’s trouble, choosing instead to endure great wrath when I have already proven you and tried you, except you will stubbornly refuse my appearing, and you will cling to wrath that is not intended for you. Did I not tell you to come out of her lest you share in her plagues?
Yet, there will be one more resurrection. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it: and death and hell delivered up the dead which were

THE

in them: and they were judged every man according to their works, for this is the resurrection of the unjust my people.
Why do you not understand that the gathering together of my Church to meet me in the clouds at my appearing is different from my return with my Bride and the armies in heaven? Why do you not understand that the gathering of my Church is a mystery revealed by the Apostle Paul in the context of the Great Mystery of God. So it is a mystery within a mystery, and it was not fully unveiled to the sons of men until it was revealed to Paul who wrote it down, and I have preserved it for you.
Yet, there are several examples of God taking people into the heavens for specific purposes. Enoch departed. Elijah departed. I departed into the heavens while my apostles watched in awe. Philip was departed from one place to another as the Father took him for my purposes. And so shall my bride be gathered to me in the clouds to be taken into the heavens to be married to me and to serve my redeeming purposes.
Do you not understand that my Bride will be kings and priests before my God and Father and will rule with me in my coming kingdom and will forever be with me? Why are you so slow to believe my words? Have you been enchanted and led astray by the wayward shepherds? Still, many of you will become a self-fulfilling prophecy and will seal yourselves to the falling away by apostatizing from my precepts, particularly the doctrine of my Church being gathered to me. Shame on you who group this doctrine to false prophets in recent history, declaring a false, secret rapture that is tied to other false doctrines of dispensations.
Understand that there are ages in God’s timeline and not dispensations, and they are not the same concept. Study to show yourselves approved, and quit being so intellectually lazy. Quit relying on and reading everyone else’s interpretation of what is written, and live by it is written: For you need not that any man should teach you. Yet, many of you will scoff and refuse my counsel. Except this thing will not be done in secret and Satan will launch a great deception to cover this event because it will be known worldwide. Great shaking will occur, and the entire world will change from the world you have known, and that man of sin will be revealed and rise from the ashes left behind by the four horseman. It is time to ready yourselves, my Bride, and do so quickly, for behold my appearing is at hand!
I am the son of Man prophesied of by Enoch, whom God took into the heavens.
I am he who was transfigured and spoke with Moses and Elijah about my departing, and God took Elijah into the heavens in his time.
I am he who was taken into a cloud as I was received into the heavens until the times of restitution.
I am he who sent Philip to the Ethiopian eunuch before God took him to another place on earth.
I am he who caught Paul away to the third heaven and showed him unspeakable things that he was not free to share.
I am he who will descend from the heavens with a great shout to gather my Bride to meet me in the air.
I am he who will raise my two witnesses to life after they are dead for three and a half days, and I till take them into the heavens.
I am he that is the Alpha and Omega, for I am the beginning and the end, and behold! I come sooner than

The Unrighteous Shall Not Inherit the Kingdom of God! (Thunders Five & Six)
APRIL 19, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach:
My son, if thou will receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that you incline your ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding. Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: and know that I, the Lord Jesus Christ, am ever with you and am ever present in your lives as you hold on to me and my salvation, for I am the head of the Body, and I am your faithful Lord, my beloved Bride. For I have prepared a place and future for you, and there is great reward for my called, and faithful, and chosen.
I have not called you to loss and punishment nor have I called you to shame and self-condemnation; have you not read there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit? So believe my words! I did not call you to live in the shadow of your past sins, nor to live in the shadow of your youthful exploits, but I have called you to die to your old sinful ways and take up newness of life in me as you put off your flesh, as you put off your sins and walk in newness of life in me. Behold! I make all things new! Is this not your hope?
My children, I have taken you from the depravity of this current dying world, and I have delivered you from the power of darkness and have translated you into my kingdom, the kingdom of God, led by me, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, of which Yahweh is God, for there is no other. I have called you to glory and virtue in me, and I have rescued you from the kingdom of Satan, the kingdom of darkness, into my Kingdom, where there is light! So, awake you who sleeps, and arise from the dead, and I, Jesus Christ, will give you light.
Have you not read in the letters I sent to my Bride, that I sent to you, my very Church? Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
Do you not understand my precepts, oh, lukewarm church of Laodicea? I did not call you to return to your flesh, nor did I call you to continue in your unrighteous ways. Think, and consider; let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall! Take heed to yourselves, and to the doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this, thou shalt both save yourself, and them that hear you. Understand, my lukewarm little ones, that you cannot live a life of compromise between good and evil, thinking you are upright before me, when you choose the lesser of two evils in your election rituals that I do not condone or endorse.
Come out of her, my people, as I have NOT provided a political solution, and I have absolutely not given you a world leader to make anything great again. You are deceived, and you are being primed to follow

and give consent to the son of perdition who openly walks among you, although he has not been revealed quite yet. But you who ask for discernment will know who he is, so that you may avoid his deception. No, compromise is not for you, as you are my children and brethren, and I did not win your salvation by giving my life as a ransom for many by compromising with Satan; for to compromise is to join their ranks. So make no mistake: You either stand for me in righteousness and true holiness, or you have joined the ranks of Satan in his dying kingdom, so REPENT!
What do you gain by compromise with evil? Do you not understand that you are to overcome evil with good? So stand fast in me and quit flip-flopping like a fish out of water. Many of you are still blown about by every wind of doctrine and sleight of hand, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. I, Christ Jesus, have spoken, and I will not be silenced.
So many of you have compromised yourselves and my church, and I ask you: how long halt you between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. Simply stated, you cannot compromise and choose any form of evil and think you are standing for me; when you choose evil, you choose the sources of that evil as your lord and master becoming the servant of sin. Know ye not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey: whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
Hear me and hear me well, my Church; know that I stand in disgust at the practices that are prevalent in your nation and around the world, that you have compromised and allowed into my Church to vex my little ones. As in the days of Noah, so shall it be. The days of Noah were a time when the earth was ruled by evil abominations made by the fallen angels, their very own seed, a seed of evil made for your complete destruction: and they will return, for behold, I bring giants to fulfill my wrath. They accomplished this by removing and violating natural boundaries that my Father set in place so that peace and righteousness could prevail, but by removing and immorally crossing the very boundaries that are obvious in nature itself, that my Father instituted, many of you have polluted yourselves by your consent of the evil prevalent in your times. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be: and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun. Have you not read, oh, ye of little faith? Removing God’s own boundaries causes insanity, and sickness, and confusion of all things. Many of you revel in mental illness, thinking a man can become a woman and a woman can become a man, and you lead your own children into your delusions. Many of you attend churches led by homosexual false ministers who are open and flamboyant in their sickness, and you think they speak for me? Know this: if you are in that sinful state, I will give you over to the lusts you so wantonly crave, and you will reap the fruit of your unclean ways.
Behold! For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. But no, it is not enough to be led by the effeminate and their lies; you allow your own children to be compromised and even mutilated before me.
There is great consequence in store for these actions, and they will not go unpunished. And yet you persist in your insanity, and unless you repent, I will spew you out of my mouth.
Come to me in repentance, and sit in sackcloth and ashes, that I may know the sincerity of your repentance and weep and howl over your sins so that you do not pay the price in judgment. So many of you are so

arrogant because you try to make me Lord while you still have a faithless heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness. So have faith that you may be saved; your faith will be indicated to all by your repudiation of sin and coming out of your filthy ways. The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. But you still consent to the ways of the sodomite, and you help bring great evil on the land, to the point that you actually vote for child molesters to lead your lands. You lack even the most elementary level of discernment, and you do not follow my way; and if you persist, I will completely give you over to your vile affections for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.
Let me open your eyes, you who are willingly ignorant and blind, you who sit in filth and darkness, rolling in the mire. You cannot give your consent to evil and think you are serving me, for I resisted evil and temptation until the very last drop of blood flowed from me onto the red earth, for I am the last Adam and I have been made a quickening spirit. So many of you are blinded by good words and fair speeches and give your full consent to criminals and horrible people who prey on children. They molest children, they torture children for their own evil lusts: For so comes the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon, but so many of you persist in giving your consent to these brute beasts who are set aside for the eternal hellfires that will never be quenched.
Come out of her, my people, or you will share in her plagues and the awful judgment that is coming on her; and I have warned you. For what concord has Christ with Belial? If you share in her lies, you will share in her plagues; so completely separate yourselves in word and in deed, and do not agree with them in the least. Do not live careless, compromised lives; for I will punish all who do. You think because you have eternal life that you can’t experience great loss and consequence? I will strip your rewards and give them away, and you will be the least in the kingdom of heaven if you persist, for so says Yeshua HaMashiach, the Bridegroom, to my Bride!
From Yahweh, the eternal God:
Oh, you worthless ones who harm my creation, you worthless ones who have sold yourselves to Satan, you worthless ones who have made Satan your God, you worthless ones who reject my son Jesus Christ and the salvation I have provided in his name, you worthless ones who have allowed your own children to burn in the fires of Moloch. I will give you the world you desire, and I have prepared you a world without me, a world without my son Christ Jesus, a world with a great lake of fire and brimstone just for you.
I will give you the darkness you so desire, for my light will not be present there, and you will spend eternity separated from me, Yahweh, the great brilliant God, whose glory and brightness no flesh can behold and who is from everlasting to everlasting. You rebellious, evil ones who have destroyed my creation from the beginning in your lusts and hate and jealousy, know that you have heaped great punishment and torment to yourselves from which you will never be healed and to all who are led astray by your lies and refusing Jesus Christ, refusing to turn from your lies to my truth.
You think that perverting my ways and removing my boundaries is a light thing, but you will understand my wrath as soon as the first flame touches you, and you will be engulfed in fire and brimstone of which you will never escape. Furthermore, you have murdered, raped, plundered, molested, hurt, killed, destroyed, and participated in the most grievous offenses, even desiring strange flesh; and you have joined yourselves to the fallen angels, so I will join you to the lake of fire that I have prepared for the Devil and his

angels, and you will not escape. You have no peace.
I will exact justice on you, for I am a God of justice, and I am a God of vengeance. Yet, you will arrogantly stand against me, pleading your case, thinking that I will somehow shrink from your satanic ways of: do what you will, shall be the whole of the law. You have no peace. I will repay, and you say that I am a loving God (which I am), but then you expect me not to exact justice on those who have polluted my creation, on those who tortured and killed my only begotten son as he gave himself a ransom for all; yea, you expect me not to exact justice on you for your worthless ways when you have killed, tortured, and maimed the innocent and you have starved my little ones for your own agendas.
Indeed, Satan himself would destroy all that is of me for his own greedy gain, and even then you try and accuse me of folly in my righteous judgments when I come to protect my own. Your days of leading my little ones astray are about to come to an end. Behold!
Your beast and false prophet will utterly be destroyed, and I will cast them alive into that great lake burning with fire and brimstone; they will wait for you to join them in your inheritance.
Great judgment is on you, oh, prince of darkness; your kingdom and all that follow you are about to be utterly destroyed. For you are no gods, and you cannot deliver your worthless selves from my hand, and I will chain you in the deepest darkness that you so desire, even the deepest abyss will I chain you with a great chain that you cannot break. Yea, in the abyss you will be for one day, for one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. And even then I will loose you for a little season that you may tempt and gather the very last of those abominable ones who would follow you and your ways. And I will then consume all of you with fire, and the thrones of judgment will be set, and I will judge all of you evildoers, and you will go to everlasting punishment from the face of the Lord. You will burn in the presence of the angels and in the presence of the lamb, and they will behold you in torment and punishment, for you have wronged them all, and you will fully pay for your sins for all eternity.
Then you will be sealed in your prison, and you will be forgotten, and you will never again come to mind, for the former things will pass away and be forgotten. For behold, I will make a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteous; and I, Yahweh, the great eternal God of all gods, for there is none like me, behold, I will make all things new, for I, Yahweh have spoken it! Yahweh, the great eternal God, will make his throne on earth, and my dwelling place will be amongst men, and you will never again be, oh, you worthless ones, and you will forever burn in your forgotten prison of torment that you can never escape, for I will set the seal and none can break it.
Yet, so many of you who sympathize with Satan accuse me of folly for taking justice and vengeance into my own hands to deliver those who made themselves worthy of everlasting punishment to the flames. Hear my words, oh, dwellers of the earth: my Son is coming, and he comes with great vengeance, anger, and fury for the wrongs done by your hands. The times of judgment, even the judgment of the great day of Christ is about to explode across the earth, and there will be no remedy for the evil ones, no remedy for Satan, and no remedy for all who have joined him, as all will go into eternal perdition, and I will give back to them all that they have inflicted on the innocent.
Therefore, I will inflict their evil hearts’ desires and all their evil works right back on them for all eternity. See my anger boiling and know that the times of restitution of all things is at hand, and no numbers are left

on the clocks in the heavens, for all the numbers have fallen from the clock face, for time is up! I counsel all who read these words to run to my son Jesus Christ in repentance and make him Lord; for no one will come to me except through Jesus Christ, for no other name have I given for salvation, and all of your idols will burn. There is time yet for salvation, and whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved. So run to Jesus Christ while you still can, for the day of the Lord has come, and I will unleash my Son, and the wrath of the Lamb will be satisfied. Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
For Reference: Isaiah 13:1 from the Septuagint: I give command, and I bring them: giants are coming to fulfill my wrath, rejoicing at the same time and insulting.

IN THE WORKS OF PETER
The Faithful Shepherd Says: You Are Like Sheep Gone Astray!
APRIL 17, 2024
Oh, my people, you are all like sheep gone astray, and each of you has turned aside to your own ways, ways that I did not make for you, but you follow the ways of false prophets who lie and swear by my holy name, and they will not go unpunished. I warn you sternly, my people, and I call heaven and earth to record my words: DO NOT reckon words of prophecy given by me, the Lord Jesus Christ, as an unholy thing; but rather, prove every word I give. Should you refuse, it is sin to your account.
I tell you before I go any further, many of you will stop your ears and close your eyes at the words that I am about to give, and I counsel you to not shrink in fear. Many of you will crater to pressure from friends and family, pressures from fake churches and worldly institutions, thinking academia represents me when worldly academia is Satan’s very own spurious knowledge, and his knowledge of good and evil always brings death, for so he designed his words to accomplish. Do not be among those who reject my words, but listen with your entire soul and consider what I will say, for my words are life, and they will make your calling and election sure.
Where in my holy Word do you see that there is such a thing as Christian Zionism? Do you not understand that their leaders are the synagogue of Satan? Yes, there are those who have infiltrated Israel who are not of Israel and are of the synagogue of Satan, and they do lie, saying they are Judeans but are not! You, my Church, are the Israel of God, and you are not a replacement, nor is this replacement theology, but my holy Word. Look and see for yourselves! No! I am not speaking against my own, though there are those among you who are wise in their own conceits who will say just that.
Check my genealogy, as I was born of the fathers, and my pedigree is sound; and if anyone among you is zealous of Israel, I am more so, for I gave my very life for them! Who are my mother and brethren? For whosoever shall do the will of God is my mother and my brethren, have you not read? I am discerning for you: good and evil, since many of you lack true spiritual discernment and are blinded by the lies of the evil ones. Have you not read that God fulfills his ways at times by the hand of his enemies, for even his enemies obey his voice? Yes, Israel was reestablished in 1948, and I love many in the land and will rescue them; but Israel was reestablished by evil men, and their leaders carry secret evil intent. It is not for you, my children, to have a hand in this part of my Father’s business during this time, though you will help in the future in my Kingdom; but it is up to me to save Jacob, not you!
You have been led astray by good words and fair speeches and have fallen for a very slick sleight of hand. You have been enchanted by the spirits of Jezebel, who work in the ways of Balaam. Know that I will break their hold on you and open your eyes and ears if you but turn to me with humility and willingness to come to my Word and learn of me without your preconceived notions that you have learned from these false spirits prophesying through their false prophets. Spirits of Jezebel speaking great lies in her false prophets, even lying signs and wonders, and prophesying for greedy gain in the spirit of Balaam, these have infiltrated your churches, and you eat filth from their very hands.

You have been deceived by the synagogue of Satan into a false alliance with them, the synagogue of Satan. Some in my Church are not faithful to my words and precepts because they have believed lies spoken in my name, sharing in their blindness, which is proper. Do not let yourselves be found among them when I come; have I not said, come out of her and be ye separate, for what concord has Christ with Belial? Wash the mud from your eyes in my atoning blood and open them to see the true light I will give you, as your eyes are crusted over with mire, and you cannot open them without me.
According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this very day, and by good words and fair speeches you have joined in their blindness, not only being blind to my purposes for Israel but also blinded from your true calling in me, Christ Jesus, your Lord! If you are blind, you are not free to read and understand my words, and you are not walking in the spirit. Therefore, follow my words, my people; for though you have known me after the flesh, after the flesh you know me no more. For I have been changed to a life-giving spirit, who has given the spirit of life to the Israel of God, even the spirit of sonship whereby you cry ABBA, Father!
Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty; therefore, stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Incline your ears and turn your hearts to hear my Word, and reject it not! The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and they are life. Therefore, do not be conformed to Israel after the flesh, and come out of her political lies, but be conformed to my spirit which is made in the image of God!
Do you not understand? Their lies are allowed to set the stage for the son of perdition, that they might all be damned who have pleasure in unrighteousness, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. Listen to my words of rebuke and harden not your hearts, for my words will save you from the calamity to come and will separate you from those who fight against me and who have rejected me for close to 2000 years now. And though blindness has happened in part to Israel, a remnant of Jacob will turn to me and accept the righteousness that doesn’t come by the law but by faith in me. Cleanse your thoughts and shake off the false words of the wolves that they have falsely whispered in your ears, even speaking falsely in my name, as I did not send them.
There is a great evil over my land, and I will come to the rescue. There is great evil on Jacob because they have allowed themselves to be subverted by Edomite liars. Have you not believed my report that the synagogue of Satan exists and is real? Know that they walk among you! Do you not understand that the blind cannot lead the blind, and Israel is blinded in part until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in? I will yet save a faithful remnant from Jacob, and I am sealing the 144,000. And they will do mighty works for me, and I will send them to and fro during Jacob’s trouble, and they will save many, and many mighty works will they do, and I will lead them to lead others, as there is no other way to the Father but through me, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah they rejected.
But you, oh, modern Christian, you lukewarm children of mine, you think you know better because you have read their writings brought in stealthily among you. And you have believed their false report, the false report from the Edomite synagogue of Satan, the temple-building cult, the very destroyers whom Satan has sent to subjugate the world. And they lead the nation that you would worship in place of the Father if you follow their cleverly devised fables, calling themselves God’s chosen people and convincing you to bless

them when they will destroy you at first chance. Know that I have not sent a political solution, and world governments serve Satan, who has bought them with the wages of unrighteousness.
Have you not read and have you not understood that I am the only solution, and I am a warrior King sent by Yahweh himself to subjugate the kingdom in righteousness and put down all rule and authority of Satan? Yea, I will break his rule in pieces, never to recover, and I will wound his lying head as prophesied, and he will burn forevermore in the hottest flames of blue, and he will swim in burning brimstone in that great lake on that great day, and he will never recover but will be destroyed and burn forever. Know that there is no unjust cruelty in my Father’s justice, but a simple recompense of Satan’s own actions and his own desires for the Father’s children and creation, so my Father will give him what he desires for you in his justice.
Have you not read? The King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Why do you follow false political leaders as if you were following me? I will tell you why so that you fully understand: Many of you follow the lies in your reference Bibles that I did not write, and I did not commission those who compiled so-called Christian-Zionist writings. There is no such thing as a Christian-Zionism, for I am not a Jewish supremacist. If I were a Zionist, I would never have turned to the Gentiles, and the nations did receive me for a time. No, they use Zionism to bring in the Antichrist with their temple they will ignorantly construct in my Father’s name, and they do dishonor my Father because they reject me, Jesus Christ. Not only did I come to my own and was rejected of my own, but many of them still reject me to this day. But you, oh, Laodicean church, you think you can hasten the fulfillment of prophecy by following their madness; for the synagogue of Satan wants a world of their own, a world without you, my children. Have I not saved you from them?
Know that Satan tried to steal my inheritance from me, for the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof. Satan wants a world without God, a world free of God, a world free of me, the chief cornerstone, and a world where the strongest survive as they genocide the earth of all but Satan’s very seed, of which they are. Israel has been infiltrated for thousands of years now by their Babylonian writings (yes, they codified the oral traditions handed down) that condemn me, the Lord Jesus Christ, which is impossible to attain as I will not be denied. And the world is about to understand my wrath and might, for I am greater than all except my Father, and it is impossible to stop me.
I have waited in patience and long-suffering, allowing my name to be blasphemed and my atoning sacrifice counted as an unholy thing so that my Bride could be saved, the very Bride who was hidden in times past in God’s great mystery, a mystery I unveiled fully to the Apostle Paul. And you can read his writings to understand, for he didn’t speak of himself, but he declared the gospel of the great Mystery of God that I gave him to unveil for me. Nobody will take what is mine, for I have paid for it with my own atoning blood, and I will recompense the evildoers.
Satan wants a world without you, my children, but so many of you foolishly give your money to support the synagogue of Satan and their unholy designs in my land and on the remnants of the nation of Israel, a nation where I will rule the earth from the throne of David in my soon-to-be unveiled kingdom. You support your own deaths, thinking you are furthering the gospel. Why is it you cannot understand that death and destruction and genocidal rulers are NOT of me but are Satan’s own seed; yes, their father is the

Devil, the Father of Lies, Satan himself. Know that he is a defeated enemy, and he fearfully knows that his days are short, and he fears his future more than anything, for he knows there will never be relief from his punishment, for God himself declares it! My children, you cannot follow Satan and serve me. For no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. So make your choice as to whom you will serve, because I never ordained my Church to have anything to do with so called Christian-Zionism, and that movement is not of me, but Satan, and he is using it to bring in the son of perdition. So many of you have lost the meaning of my words, thinking “anti” means in staunch opposition to and nothing more. No, the man of sin is cleverly sent in place of me to a people who rejected me, and yet I will save Jacob through great trouble, and I will not only purge my land of inheritance, but I will purge the entire world from evil and sin. Understand that I will save Jacob by promises my Father made to their fathers, and it is not by merit or their own righteousness, for no flesh is righteous in my sight.
I counsel you to put down the writings of those who do not speak for me, and be wise, my children; for many of you are so naive that you cannot discern lies from truth. For you do not hold me as your head but hold the words spoken by false prophets of Jezebel, who work in the ways of Balaam, following the rewards of unrighteousness. For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Return to my pure Word of God, for the Father protects it to this very day.
Understand my methodology, my people, and learn of me. I did not choose one voice to represent my scripture, and I did not choose the oldest voice to rule my words and verify their authenticity. No, in my Father’s ways (my Father needs no counselor in his plans) and in my Father’s wisdom he chose many voices from many times, places, and cultures that agree with each other. Look to the Byzantine, my children, and doubt not my words, and delve into the texts I have preserved, and humble yourselves to my words. Were you not commanded to study to show yourselves approved? For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light: For they are wise in evil and deception, and they do nothing more than steal, kill, and destroy.
My Father has protected his pure word of God, and it is right under your noses, but you reject it so that you can have your lazy desires catered to with easy-to-read versions, corrupt versions that I did not send nor author. Why will you turn away at these words? In your naive foolishness, you do not understand that Satan counterfeits even the Holy Scriptures. He does so in the same way that a dishonest cheater would cheat by removing links from a chain one at a time to make the chain shorter while nobody notices. Aren’t boundaries moved incrementally? For what fowler sets the snare in the bird’s sight? He has changed words, removed entire sections and verses, added words, and he has done so all in a push to unify all religions under an ecumenical push to subjugate all to his false Christ, who walks among you openly, soon to be revealed.
I will cast the beast and false prophet alive in the lake burning with fire and brimstone so that they may come to their inheritance, an inheritance my Father has prepared for the Devil and his angels. For he will give them a world of their own and a world suitable for their evil desires that they wish on you, my children. Have you not learned or have you forgotten that gnostic cults altered my epistles as soon as they received

them? And you think it can’t happen in your times, when knowledge is increased?
Search out my pure word, and have faith that I am capable to provide honest translators. Have faith in the words I have given; have faith in the words of the Word of God. Do not be so naive to think that any writing is perfect; have I not told you to study to show yourselves approved? But my people, when you study, you let the enemies of the cross interpret my words so that you may be manipulated into providing consent for the synagogue of Satan. You ignorantly give your consent and tacit approval to Satan and his children who have usurped my holy lands, but only for a season, and Jacob’s trouble will cleanse them away from the land, and the meek shall inherit the earth. Have faith in me, the Word made flesh, to provide you truth; and truth is in my Holy Scriptures, for they speak of me.
Will you reject my words, my people? Will you choose to discredit the messengers I have sent? For I have sent many! Many of you will persist in your insanity, not even taking the time to verify the words of this prophecy, and you will do so to your own detriment and loss of reward. As soon as the restrainer is removed and my Bride is taken, they will move with great haste to kill everything and anyone who is Christian. They will purge Christianity from the earth if they could, and they will persecute and martyr my saints in many ways, and those who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Turn to me now, and cleanse your hearts from their lying words. You have heaped words of death and destruction to yourselves in complete ignorance of your own history. I challenge you to study the history of the books I didn’t write that you elevate above my own words. Study who the authors really were, for they authored great lies into their books, for you will know them by their fruits. Many of these books have been made the standard in your seminaries; search it out, for it is true! If you will be diligent in these matters and hold to me, then I will lead you into all truth, and you will finally understand the mystery of Godliness of which you are. But even the great mystery has been cheapened in your minds and hearts by their lies; that great mystery is one new man taken from Judean and Gentile alike, where there is no more wall of separation, for that wall is done away in me.
Many of you cling to an Old Testament verse taken out of context: ignorantly thinking that you must support genocidal maniacs to be blessed by me. I bless those who have been called by my name, and though I cause it to rain on the righteous and unrighteous alike, all blessings are in me, Christ Jesus your Lord, the true Lord of Lords and true King of Kings. Therefore, turn to me in repentance, for you have taken the lies of Jezebel as gospel truth, and you have heaped wrath to yourselves in so doing; for I will even give my children according to their works, though I will not judge you by your sins.
I am the Lamb of God chosen before the foundation of the World.
I am a warrior King sent by Yahweh.
I am he whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things.
I am he who was baptized by John the Baptist when the spirit descended like a dove to the sound of my Father’s own voice.
I am he who came to my own and who was rejected, a man of sorrows who paid the highest price for you all.
I am greater than all except my Father, Yahweh.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach. also known as Jesus Christ. and ιησου χριστου in Greek and in many other

Why Have You Forsaken My Mysteries?
APRIL 15, 2024
Why have you forsaken my mysteries, oh, lukewarm Laodicean church? Why have you forsaken the great mystery of God? You have exchanged the most sacred secrets of the Father, even Christ in you the hope of glory, for filthy lucre, and your God has become your belly. Yet, you will say to me, “There is no fault in me. I am not chasing filthy lucre, for I am upright before you.” And I retort: Do you not chase after the fake prosperity gospel taught in your Laodicean churches? You have sold the truth of God’s most sacred mysteries for base gain, and you no longer have the hope of glory that I passionately want you to understand, but you have changed the hope of glory into the hope of material gain that you seek to gather for yourselves by your impure thoughts. I did not call you to money and materialism, but to righteousness and true holiness that is found in me.
Turn from your errors and buy eye salve of me, that you may anoint your eyes to see the truths in Scripture I have given you for your own salvation. You have been duped into supporting world governments, thinking that by supporting them you are supporting God’s chosen. You should feel shame before me because in your ignorance you do not understand who the true Israel of God is, and you no longer understand the great mystery of God that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel. For I am your peace, who has made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between you.
You have allowed your identity to be stolen by the synagogue of Satan, and you have lost yourselves in the words of false prophets. Do you not understand that you are the Israel of God? As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Oh, lukewarm church, who will save you from your adulterous fornication that has corrupted you from the single mindedness that is in me, Christ Jesus your Lord? You cannot hang on to this dying world, thinking that in so doing you serve me; and you should repent of your support of evil world governments, for what concord has Christ with Belial, and they do not serve me but Satan. Go to my Scripture and seek your true self that I have hidden in my epistles; for you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. And he that is dead is freed from sin, and the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new. I have created you in me as a newborn, taking your first breath in eternity; for eternity started for you the second you were born again of my spirit, for I have made of two one new man, so making peace. Yes, one new man in me composed of Judean and Gentile alike in my church of God. Those I have called to newness of life in me are God’s chosen people, and those born of my spirit are the true sons of God, and if any man has not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
Why do you disallow sections of Scripture, counting them unholy because of your so- called positive thinking? Why do you divide Scripture, thinking that the entire Word of God is not for your doctrine, practice, and learning? Fake positive thinking at the expense of the truth blinds you to my ways and my purposes that I have preordained for you. Yes, you should set your thoughts on things above, but do not

call sections of my Scripture doom and gloom because you do not consider it positive thinking. You are trapped in Christian witchcraft, practicing the very knowledge of the fallen angels who taught mankind sorcery and witchcraft and root cuttings to begin with.
Your fallen-angel knowledge is a cunningly crafted lie designed to snare your soul by good words and fair speeches. Know that many evil men over the years have introduced occultism into Christianity, telling you that if you think something long enough, it has to happen as you think. You fool! God did not create you to build your own delusion around your self-help Christianity and happy thoughts. You follow another Jesus and have left the faith that is in me, and you have deserted my words and precepts in favor of good words and fair speeches, and you have been corralled by greedy wolves who lie to you.
They lie to you and misapply the law of Moses, telling Christians they should tithe to support their organizations that are not built on me, the chief cornerstone. Check Scripture, and understand that as a man purposes in his heart, so let him give and give cheerfully, for God loves a cheerful giver. And this is a key precept in the New Testament ratified in my blood. The tithe was to support the Levitical priests, and they supported the high priest with the heave offering. This is done away in me, for I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek and have made you priests and kings before me. But you, oh, lukewarm church, you are blinded with visions of false power and abilities, abilities not found in Christ.
You control nothing by your thoughts alone, and you are blind to me and my purposes that I have prepared for you. You have stopped your ears from hearing sound doctrine in favor of false doctrines that tickle your ears. Not only that, but you attack the brethren who have become your enemy because they tell you the truth in these matters, and you have rejected the Berean mindset in favor of emotionalism miscalled Christianity. Understand this, wayward shepherds: you will be recompensed in judgment for leading my sheep astray, and vengeance is mine and I will repay.
Understand this, my children: you control nothing by your positive thinking, and you are not a prosperity magnet on account of your happy thoughts. You are deceived and have been led astray by many deceivers. Furthermore, you can do nothing without me just as I can do nothing without my Father; for it is God who empowers the righteous and the Father who has created all, and each to glorify Yahweh’s righteous name above all!
Come out of your greed and forsake the love of money, for the love of money is the root of all evil.
When you close your eyes to my entire gospel and selectively pick and choose what you consider “positive,” you are in the ditch with blind leaders who led you both to that end. I did not call you to fall in a ditch my children, but I called you to live before me in righteousness and true holiness, so rise up out of the mire. I called you to forsake your sins and repent of your unrighteous ways. Only by my atoning blood can you be purged from your sins; your positive thoughts do not work righteousness, though you have made them the idols of your heart.
Why do you allow false brethren and Judaizers into your midst to spy out the liberty you have in me, the righteous Lord? Had you understood the great mystery of God, you would understand that Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that believes, For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the Law, that the man which does those things shall live by them. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. What of the Mosaic law, then?

I have fulfilled the requirements of the law and justified man by faith in me, for I have overcome, and I have fulfilled the law, giving myself as the perfect Passover once and for all; therefore, the just shall live by faith. Have you not read that I did not come to destroy the law or the prophets but to fulfill the law and give righteousness to men by their identification with me, their Lord Jesus Christ.
This I say then, walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh, and there is no law against the fruit of the spirit. Therefore, you are buried with me by baptism into my death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father: even so you also should walk in newness of life. Only in my atoning works, as the sinless lamb of God, can anyone overcome sin and be freed from the curse of the law; for I have been made a curse for you, for cursed is any man who hangs on a tree.
Moses described the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. Christ is the end of the law for everyone that believes, yet so many of you will reject these very words because you revere the words of your pastors, preachers, and rabbis more than the words of your Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus. Do you not understand that you are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone? For no other foundation can any man lay, then that is laid, which is Jesus Christ; therefore, you are not under law but grace.
For those who believe can enter into my rest, for he that is entered into my rest has also ceased from his own works, as God did from his on the seventh day. Know you not that the law was your schoolmaster to bring you to me, Christ Jesus? Yet many have rejected me and my grace and my mercy in favor of their own pointless works of righteousness. Blindness in part has come to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes to consummation. Oh, wild olive branch, boast not yourself against the olive tree you are grafted into, and do not follow their blindness; for I am able to save Jacob and I will do just that as a remnant shall be saved.
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days. Why do you place a burden on my children, telling them they must pronounce my name in some sacred language? I understand all languages and look on the heart, so I know when my children call on my name in whatever language they call, and I seal them with my Father’s seal accordingly, and I bring them into the Church of God. Neither the fathers nor you are able to keep the law, but the law is fulfilled in you in my righteousness; for the law comes down to two great commandments: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.
Righteousness does not come by the law but by faith in me, the Lord Jesus Christ. For I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, and by my atoning blood you are justified, for I am the perfect Passover, and I am the lamb of God. Let no man lead you astray in these matters. The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient. Behold! I have blotted out the handwriting of ordinances, that was against you, which was contrary to you, and took it out of the way, nailing it to my cross. Yet, you still desire to be in bondage to the weak and beggarly elements. What saith Scripture: Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for we are not children of the bondwoman but the free.
Have I not plainly stated: Behold! I show you a mystery, we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, for I will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first, then you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds to meet

your me, Christ Jesus in the air, and so shall you ever be with me. Oh, Laodicean church, you reject even my plainest words to you. Therefore, know that I will reject you from my table, when I greatly desire to set a place for you in the heavens.
You think it but a light thing to reject my words and lead others astray in your error. Therefore, since you want the day of the Lord, I will leave you to endure the day of the Lord, seeing you arrogantly think you can stand. You reject my appearing and magnify the words of false prophets over sound doctrine that I have given in me. Have you not read the parable of the ten virgins? I counsel you to have faith in my words and deny me not, so I won’t have to deny you. Which will you be, my children? Will you be amongst the wise virgins who prepared themselves with trimmed wicks and oil in your lamps? Or will you take your place with the unwise virgins, saying, Lord, Lord open to us; and I will say to them, I know you not!
Have you not read? For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church. Do you not understand the words of the bridegroom, my bride? You are to hold to me as your head in the same manner that a wife holds to her husband as her head, for the Bride is my Church and my body, and what man ever hated his own flesh? Yet, you allow the wayward shepherds to lead you astray in this matter, and many of you esteem twisted words from twisted false prophets over my Holy Word.
You have placed your faith in wicked men, men I have not sent; yet they deceive you with good words and fair speeches that I have not given them. You follow them as if you are following me. Repent! Many of you are following false ministers who appear as ministers of righteousness. No marvel, though, for Satan transforms himself into an angel of light, so it should be no surprise that his ministers do the same. Many of you are blinded by false light, from false ministers that I have not sent, and they speak great swelling words that are contrary to the sound doctrine in me, the Lord Jesus Christ.
Take a stand for yourselves, oh, spineless Christians, and come out of her and depart from Mystery Babylon. I would that you were hot or cold and not lukewarm, and I have no desire to spew you out of my mouth. Therefore, return to me, my children, and return to my words. Hold me as your head, for I am the Lord who died for you, and you resurrected when I did. Why do you rely on false prophets? You need not that any man should teach you, but the anointing you have received of me abides in you and teaches you all things, oh, ye of little faith! Turn to me and return to the narrow path. Weep, howl, and repent, my children! As many as I love, I rebuke, that your calling and election may be sure.
Know that I love you dearly and desire your full heart over your works. Come to me with an open heart and give me your all, as I have given my all for you. Fear not and do not condemn yourselves, for there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. Just return to me and confess your sins, and I will forgive you and restore you to the purposes and gifts I have given you. Stand strong and steadfast, for I will very soon appear suddenly, and the world will know that I have snatched you away, as this thing will not be done in secret. Time is short, my children, and very soon time will be no more.

Every Secret Will Come to Light!
APRIL 12, 2024
Have you not read? Every secret will come to light. Have you not read? Every hidden thing will be exposed. Have you not read? Every heart’s intent will come before me. Every tongue will confess to me, says the Righteous Lord and Righteous King, who rules in righteousness. Oh, my people, why do you choose the error of Adam and Eve, who from the beginning tried to hide their shame in their own works, for they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. Yet, God saw what happened and knew they would stumble before he created them. And what did the Father do for them? HE MADE them coats of skins and clothed them apart from their own works.
Why do you think you can hide your sins from me, my children? I see all of you and know you better than you know yourselves. Stop listening to the wayward shepherds who preach another Jesus; indeed in broken cisterns they offer lukewarm water to a lukewarm church wrapped in false sincerity and so-called positive thinking. They lie to you with self-help Christianity, telling you out-of-context truths such as God loves you the way you are. While the Father’s love is undying and white-hot for his children, true Christianity preaches repentance and remission of sins, sins that are confessed in honesty with a pure heart which leads to salvation and wholeness. Yet, many in my Church rationalize and justify their sins. They rationalize in their own philosophies and seek a false perch, looking down on their brethren in arrogant pretense as they wrap their iniquities in their own false justification. Is this not the knowledge of Satan when he offered the forbidden fruit to the mother of all the living? Are these not the works of the flesh?
I ask you a question; all of you know the answer. What are the wages of sin? What does the Holy Scripture declare those wages to be? Is it not death? Yet, many of you feel that your sins are justified and are even part of you and what makes you unique, as you abuse my grace. In dying, you shall die. Even though you have eternal life in me, and I will forgive you all and will not cast you away if you remain in me, in dying you shall die.
From your first breath, you are perishing due to the sin nature in you.
When you continue in sin and sow to the flesh, you will reap corruption every time, because in dying you shall die. Sin will eventually kill every aspect of your lives and even your flesh to your last breath if you continue. Not only that, but you will lose your reward and stand in shame in the heavenlies at my judgment seat as the wood, hay, and stubble you treasured to yourselves burns to nothing in front of you, and you will suffer loss as I will strip your reward and give it to another, for I am the righteous judge. Why come to me in repentance and then return to your own vomit? What do you accomplish? Do you not understand that you can’t serve me and Satan at the same time? If you sin, you are the servant of sin until you come clean with me, and every tongue will confess! Why do you desire to return to the weak and beggarly elements? All they will ever do is seek to kill you as they carry you away as plunder.
Know that the evil spirits brag over my children they are able to capture. Why do you choose to bring shame to your own name and make yourselves a laughingstock? You have forgotten your first love, and many of you are involved in Christian witchcraft and self-help Christianity, a version of faith without me,

for I will not enter the Laodicean church but stand at the door and knock. I say to you plainly, your positive thinking controls nothing, and you are deceived.
Are the pleasures of sin for a short season that important to you? Do you not understand that I will reward you richly with heavenly things for your troubles and trials? I will recompense what you sacrifice for me in my name. Return to your first love, my children, and come to me and come out of Babylon. For the great harlot’s days are numbered, and there will be no remedy for her; therefore, come out from her, my people, and be ye separate that you share not in her plagues. Depart from lust and the works of the flesh. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world and the world is passing away.
Flee fornication and share not in their shame and consequence. My children, it’s as if you are doing the deed yourselves when you draw pleasure from perverseness and depravity. Forsake your greedy ways, for I will punish those who heap riches to themselves, and soon your money will be worthless. Push into my spirit, for my spirit is life and peace. Depart from evil and sin not! Reap the fruit of the spirit in me, for I have empowered you over your sins if you will come clean with me. Do you think you can hide something from my gaze? I have been empowered to see, and I and my Father are one in unity and purpose. It is impossible to hide, and it is impossible to hide your sins from me. Many of you have no idea how ridiculous you appear when you self- righteously act as if you have no sin, and yet your eyes burn for lust that sets your loins ablaze.
Understand that the thief uses many vices and ploys against you. If you follow my will to resist and turn to me, I am an ever present help in time of need and I will succor you, I will protect you, I will purge you and make a way to escape the many temptations you face, but you have to resist with everything in you. It means nothing when you say you are sorry and go right back to your vomit, but you would cringe to see a dog do the same, yet in your arrogance you think you are different, so don’t act like a wild dog.
Sin is sin. The only way to beat sin is by my atoning blood and to rest in me. The spirit I have poured on you will empower you. I have created a new nature in you, and if you but ask, I will create a clean heart in you.
So stop your filthy mouths, close your lustful eyes in prayer, and depart from iniquity, and I will cleanse you. Yes, I will cleanse you fully as white as fresh snow when you confess and also change and turn from your filthy ways. As many as I love, I rebuke; and as many as I love, I chastise. What father chastises not his own child? Though many do just that, these are not my ways, and these are not the ways of my Father. Since God deals with you as children, he will also chastise you as children; for if he chastises you not, then you are not his children but bastards.
But you are his children, so give ear to my words and endure chastisement, and heed the warnings, for life and happiness awaits. No chastisement seems joyous at the time, but it will lead to the peaceable fruits of righteousness. Come to me, and I will purge you of your old ways, and I will teach you my ways that you may walk in righteousness and peace. Help your brethren and become an example of repentance, for in your stand you will break many chains and many bonds, even the bonds you grasp in your own hands and hold tightly to yourself. I counsel you to let them all go. Sin leads to bondage, and it pays death; therefore, come out of her, that you share not in her judgments.

Come to me, for I am he that walks among the seven lampstands and he that will preserve your reward if you but come to me in humility, forsaking your worthless pride.

Be of Good Cheer!
APRIL 10, 2024
My little ones, be of good cheer; have I not overcome the wicked one and redeemed you by my own blood? Why should you be discouraged? Why are you heavy of heart; do you think I have forgotten you? No, instead of looking to your own understanding, seek my wisdom, which is from above; for by godly wisdom shall you be led, so forsake her not! Doesn’t wisdom still cry aloud in the streets? So fear not and be of good cheer, for I have overcome and you too will overcome, so as yet by my own blood. Allow my peace to comfort your hearts and allow my words to soothe your soul, for I am with you.
Who will separate you from my love? Will peril, or will the sword, or will famine separate you? I say not, and look and know that you are secure in me. Know that I have sealed you with my Father’s seal, and that seal cannot be broken or stripped away from you, so remain in me, your Lord, strength, and redeemer. Behold! I have purchased you in my own blood, I have called you by name, I have sealed you according to your faith in my name, and whosoever believes therein shall be saved by faith, for the just shall live by faith!. Keep your hope alive and let it strengthen you, and add endurance to your love and faith, for you are saved to hope. Great hope and great expectation are yours, for I have declared it.
Why are you cast down and sad? Behold! I have overcome, and soon you will be with me, and you will see me with your own eyes, and you will know as you are known.
Look! Says the great Lord, the mighty Lord who is Lord of Lords. Look to me in your sadness and troubles. I know your hearts, and I know full well that you love me and long to be with me as I long to be with you; only faint not. Answer me this, the short time left in your wait – will it compare to eternity with me, my bride? No, your sufferings and tribulation on earth are not worthy to compare to the glory that I am about to reveal in you, for you will be as I am, and you will see me as I am, so do not allow your hearts to be troubled. Understand your times and always be on the ready, for my appearing will happen suddenly, and it will exceed your expectations.
Behold, my children! The world will know that I love you and that you are mine, and Satan will cause great deception to deceive those who perish, but it will not come near you. No, judgment is not for you, and neither is my wrath. Understand, my children, that in me, you are righteous, not righteous in your own works, but righteous in the righteousness I have clothed you with. Cast not away the garments I have clothed you in, and quench not my spirit. Though it is the end-times, I will pour out my spirit, and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your old men will dream dreams. There is yet work to be done, and my final move in these times of grace will outpace the day of Pentecost when I first poured out on my chosen the spirit I received of my Father. Great works are at your fingertips and there are many yet to be saved, so do my work and minister to my children and seek my lost sheep. Ask of me and I will commission you, as I have enabled you with a great enabling and I have given gifts unto men. Who can stand against you, though you have this treasure in earthen vessels? Why do you yet doubt me? In your own weakness is my strength perfected in you. Therefore, abound in the work of the Lord, my children.

Check my Holy Word, for as I raised the dead, so you can do the same. Anoint your eyes with eye salve that you may see the many mighty healings I did to set the captives free when I came to my own; so too can you do the same. Have I not stated that he that believes on me, he shall do the same works, and greater works shall he do because I have gone to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God: You are kings and priests before me and you are seated in the heavenlies, so why do you still doubt? Have but the faith as a grain of mustard seed, for it is a very small seed that produces a mighty tree, so shall you be if you continue steadfast in me.
Why do you confuse my words and ignore the details in my speech? I lie not: you can do what I have commissioned you to accomplish if you remain faithful. Speak my Word with great authority and boldness. Say to those mountains, Be cast into the sea! My words are truth and life, so believe not the lies of the wayward shepherds who say you cannot do what I am telling you. Take the lesson. You want to heal the sick? Command the sickness to depart in my name, and say the words with faith in me and faith in the words I will give you. Speak it to become so, for life and death are in the power of the tongue; how powerful are your tongues as you speak the power of God and command the impossible.
Speak with boldness. Speak with confidence. Speak in faith, doubting nothing; for I have sent you and empowered you. Why do you ask a spirit to depart in my name with trepidation on your lips? Command it to leave in my name with all boldness and confidence, because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Behold! The evil spirits fear you and shrink from your words, so why do you fear the weak and beggarly elements that are defeated and awaiting the fire? Fear not, but only believe!
Go forth in my name and do my mighty works. Remember your first love and rest in the rest I have given you. Cease from your own labor and burdens, and take my yoke upon you; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Do the works I have prepared for you and walk in them, for in so doing you will save many from the flames, and fruit will abound to your account. The time is at hand, my bride, and the end of your course is near, nearer than you think. But hear me, my children; hear me, my bride! Intercede while there is yet time. Heal the sick while the Son shines in your life, empowering you with my power.
Seek my lost sheep; call them, for there are many yet to save in these final seconds of refreshing. For soon you will come to your inheritance in me, and you will realize your full life in me; for your lives are hidden in me, and when I will appear, so too will the fullness of life that the Father has bestowed on you in me. I love you dearly, my little ones, so love the lost in the same manner. Do not judge them or disparage their plight, for they are overcome by Satan as you once were; so remember the deliverance I did for you and give it to the ones in need. Though many will resist you, do not stop until my sheep are gathered, for very soon my wheat will be gathered safely in my barn. Those who deny my appearing deny me and deny my word; so strengthen yourselves in my word and stop believing the thieves, for thieves are also liars.

I am he that endured to his last breath, striving against sin with my own sinless blood. I am he that was raised the third day and ascended to my Father. I am he that walked amongst my disciples and apostles for forty days, even seen above five hundred
brethren at one time, and seen and handled by many, for a spirit has not flesh and blood. I am he that was taken up, while they watched me, into the clouds. I am he whose brightness is brighter than the sun, for I reflect my Father’s glory. I am about to reveal great glory in you. I am with you always, even until the end of the age.

IN THE WORKS OF JOHN THE BAPTIST:
Judgment on Mystery Babylon (USA) Watchman, Awake!
APRIL 5, 2024
Watchman, awake, and gird your loins with truth, and have on the breastplate of righteousness!
Watchman, awake, and take to yourselves the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God!
Watchman, awake, and have your feet covered with the preparation of the Gospel of peace!
Warn my people and hold not your tongue, as I have loosened it! Fight for my people and warn my chosen, for a prophet’s reward will you have if you but speak the words I will give you. AWAKE! Have I not told my people to watch for my coming? Aren’t the times and seasons discernible and upon you? Therefore, look for my appearing, for it is at hand. Look to the signs and wonders in the sky, for my Father has arranged their orbits from the beginning, and the day is marked. Look for my brightness in the sky as the trumpet is about to sound; behold, I have declared it.
My people, check my Word and look to my Holy Scripture to understand that I will snatch away my bride from the judgment of evildoers. I will protect my bride and my body; for what man ever hated his own flesh, but nourish and cherish it? Look, pay attention, observe the seasons, and know that the times are here and the day will break forth suddenly as a great sun rising suddenly over the horizon. I will not be denied, and I will not be stopped. Though the thief will try, he will roar as a lion; but a toothless lion is all he is. He will not stop me, and I will not be denied my possession, for I have purchased the earth and especially my people in my own sinless blood. And my name stands above all except my Father’s, who is greater than I; and I will not be denied, hindered, or stopped.
I am coming, and I will not hold my peace, and my anger is hot against Secret Babylon, yea, Secret Babylon who traffics the little ones for merchandise into the hands of evil men, who will be stopped. It would be better that they had never been born than to be born and commit lawless and grievous sins against the children. It would be better that a millstone were hung around their necks, and they were cast into the seas; but they are reserved for everlasting fire, and justice will soon be done, as the wrath of the Lamb is about to cover the entire earth and Jacob’s trouble breaks loose when the restrainer is removed.
Steady yourselves, my people, and stand firm in me with a single heart and single- minded purpose. Forsake the worldly things you have desired, and set me, the Lord Jesus Christ, as your desire; for I am your strong tower, rock of defense, and rearward. Who will come against you that can withstand my mighty hand? My chosen and faithful are in my outstretched hands, and no one can take you from me. You are mine, and you are secure in me; so rest in me from your own labors, for the times of recompense will break free suddenly. A recompense of judgment on the evildoers is here, and the recompense of my faithful is upon my chosen, as I will reward them with their inheritance, for I have made them worthy.
Oh, you worthless, toothless dragon; you ancient serpent: your time has come and judgment is upon you. Though you arrogantly think you will be victorious, I will take everything you have gathered into your thieving hands, and those who follow you in their lustful greed will share in your inheritance in the lake

of fire, where everyone will be rewarded according to their works many times over. The wrath of God will abide on you for all eternity, and rest you will never have.
Great punishment will be your comforter, and the acrid smoke of burning brimstone will forever be in your nostrils, and you will pay for all eternity. And the smoke of your torment will rise forever, and all who follow you from the least to the greatest will have their inheritance and reward with you in white-hot flames of blue that will forever cover you as you will be bound and cast to your fate. There will be great weeping and gnashing of teeth. And you thought yourselves able to stand against Yahweh and his Christ, yet you will be brought to nothing but everlasting contempt in your unending torment, and forever will you be sealed away. And never will you harm my creation again, and you will be utterly forgotten about, and you will not come to mind.
So my people, my faithful bride whom I love dearly, what is there for you to fear? My wrath and the wrath of your Father is not for you and will not come upon you, and never will you be in danger of the second death. So fear not as I will exact perfect vengeance on your adversaries, for vengeance is mine, saith the Lord! Know ye not that you will judge angels? Know ye not that you will judge the world? So purify yourselves in me, for it is only my atoning blood that will make you worthy to stand before me in glory. Bind my word in your hearts, and keep my writings in your forehead, and rest in my sayings of old; for life they are unto you, and your life is hid in me, and I will reveal it!
Oh, Secret Babylon, that you had understood the peace offering my Father has sent you, and you have now rejected me, Jesus the Nazarene, and it has happened according to the holy writings that evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse. But you, oh, Secret Babylon the great, have desecrated my Father’s bow of many colors that he gave to Noah and all mankind as a promise that he would never destroy the entire earth by water again, and he will keep his word. But you, oh, Mystery Babylon, will be laid waste in one hour.
Great fire will come upon you; great shaking will flatten you; your towers will fall; your infrastructure will disappear in ruins, and great waves will overtake your coasts, and I will reward you according to your works, and great judgment is against you. For you were once a beacon of hope and a light to the world for a short season, but you have chosen greed, selfishness, and corruption as your bedfellows, oh, great harlot! Who will save you from me and my anger and my approaching wrath that is hot on you? You stand in chains, awaiting your final judgment, which will be evident for the world to see, and great fear will come on many.
Behold! Many nations my Father has overthrown in judgment, for he sets up one and brings down another, for Yahweh is sovereign and there is none greater than the great eternal God who stands for and saves his own from the fires reserved for the evil ones. Behold! The nations that made up great empires still remain, yet in a diminished way, but continued they have. But you, oh, great harlot, you have prostituted yourself with many lovers for base greediness and the pleasures of sin. You have led my people away from me worldwide by the filth you have offered the nations to eat and drink, and you will be utterly cast down, and never again will you be. And of your ashes a great nation will not arise, yet a remnant will be saved. The hand of the enemy is on your necks, and I have brought the dregs into your borders. They will pillage, plunder, and seize what remains. Who will help you?
For you have denied your neighbor, and there is no fear of the Lord in your hearts. You have said, I am no

widow, yet you are widowed and blind and deaf before me. There is no salvation for you on account of your adulterous fornication that you have committed with the world; therefore, I will bring you to utter ruin. Coming events will happen faster and faster; then a great deluge will cover your skirts. Fire will burn you utterly and will cleanse the evildoers from the land, and my captives will be freed, and nothing can stop what is about to happen. I am the Lord Jesus Christ, and I tell you before it happens, and I declare what is about to happen as if it has occurred already, for certain are these sayings, and nothing can alter them, as prophecies shall be fulfilled.
Stand firm, my people, as I will catch my bride away; for I have plans and purposes for her in my coming kingdom. She will always be with me, and she will never depart from me. I love and cherish her in perfect love and compassion. I will make you mighty in my glory, and you will do mighty works in your coming inheritance, so fear not. Know that my heart breaks, and I am saddened by my people who have not readied themselves. Some will be left behind because the god of this world has blinded their minds, and many are not ready. Fear not, though you will endure much for me, all of you will be saved who carry the seal of the living God. I will provide for you if you do not deny my name, if, and you labor for me in the work I have given you.
You will do mighty works if you but ask me to commission you. I have called you and I love you dearly, and those who call on my name and endure to the end will be saved and resurrected into great glory and rewarded for all eternity for your stand, as I love you and have spoken it for your ears. There are several harvests and each in their own turn, so fear not; for desperate times always are given great men of God to shepherd the flock, and I have called you. My angels will seal the 144,000, and some of you will help them in their works and commission that I have given them. Fear not, for I will do many signs, miracles, and wonders by your hands, so rest in my love and rest in my strength; for I am with you and I will never leave you nor forsake you.
You will know that I have snatched my bride away, and I will have gathered the faithful to me to engender repentance for many in a dying world. So let the world pass and share not in her calamity and fate for it is not for you if you will yet sanctify the Lord in your hearts and live set apart for me. For great evil is approaching, and never has it risen in this manner, and never again will it arise, my little ones, for I have declared it. Take comfort in the path I have laid for you, and keep your feet steadfast in the way. I will be with you and will give you a peace that passes comprehension, and you will have peace amongst a world of chaos, a peace that will keep you if you turn not to the left nor to the right.
Take not the mark, and don’t believe the lies. They will offer peace and health and safety for those who take the mark, and they will tell you that you are entering a new world of peace and prosperity and safety. Believe not the lies of the snake, for their king will surely not keep his word. That man of sin has but one mission, and that is: destroy.
There is no truth in him, and Satan himself will control his reins. There will be no peace from him, but every word will be a soothing lie, designed to lead the world into utter destruction. And had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be saved from the scourge he will bring on the land, for he will be empowered to complete my purposes for a short time. Then he will be bound in heavy chains of darkness in the abyss to be loosed a little season to deceive the world one last time. When he has gathered them to himself, they will mount an attack against that great city, and fire from God will destroy them all. Then the

final judgment, yea, the great white throne judgment will break forth on them all, and they will be without remedy. I tell you these things to give you hope and prepare my people, for the Great Mystery of God will even be brought to consummation.

I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. I am he that is worthy to open the seals, and the times are here. I am he who tries the reins of my chosen ones so that I may purify you and cleanse you in my atoning blood. I am the Son of God come in the flesh, crucified, and resurrected the third day, seen by many, and received
into the heavens before their very eyes. I am the son of David, and I will gather the remnant of Jacob under my arms of comfort and strength. I am he that will fulfill all of my Father’s will. I am about to make my enemies my footstool, and woe to those who oppose me, for great is the wrath of
the Lamb. I am he who will subjugate my Father’s creation and give all things into his hand, that God may be all in all. I am he whose kingdom is for everlasting to everlasting, and I will give to my chosen to eat from the tree of
life and to drink of the rivers of living waters, and you will never hunger or thirst again, and I will wipe all tears away from your eyes. I, the Lord, have spoken it, and I will make it so. The time is here, so watch for my appearing, as nothing can stop my mighty hand.

Have I Not Justified You?
APRIL 1, 2024
Be still and be at peace, and know that I am the Lord who has called you to stand before me upright in all of your ways. Have I not justified you? Have I not made you righteous in me, the Lord Jesus Christ? Are you not identified with me in my sufferings and in my glory? I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I lie not. Have not the Holy Scriptures declared it? Stand faithful and upright, and be at peace in your hearts, and know that I, the Lord Jesus Christ, have given you perfect forgiveness and peace before me if you will yet hear my words and receive my instruction.
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore, get wisdom – not the wisdom of the world that comes to nothing, but the wisdom of the Lord. And rest under my mighty hand. For the fear of the Lord is to depart from evil and to walk upright before me, says the mighty Lord, yea the Lord Jesus Christ. Hear my voice! Hear my voice and listen to no other! Many voices contradict my Word and lie to you, as they seek dominion over your very souls that they might make a spoil of you if you follow them. Love not the world, my children, neither the things in the world. This present evil world is coming to an end, and I, the Lord, have said it, and I will not be silenced by your unbelief, and I will not be silenced by your lack of faith. No, I will shout even louder so that you may know the truth of the words I speak. Compare them with Holy Scripture. Am I not the word made flesh who dwells among you? Have I not given you an anointing and a comforter until I come?
Know, my children, that I have purchased you with my own blood, and the earth is mine, and very soon righteousness will have its rule on the earth. I have spoken it. I have given you life in me; only reject not my ways. I have given you a purpose; only reject not the life I have called you to. I have given you a calling, yea, a high calling that is eternal and has no end of days if you will yet turn to me. Turn to me with open face and heart, and allow me to purge you of your sins and iniquities in my atoning blood. As many as I love, I rebuke, that you may stand before me upright in fine white linen that I will give you shortly.
All of your own clothes are but filthy rags that you have chosen for yourself to hide from me. But there is nowhere anyone can hide from my gaze, and I see you as you truly are, and as I have created you new in me. There is great reward treasured up for my faithful children; but for those who reject me, I will reject you. Why do you yet hold to this dying world and its troubles and pain? You have a choice in me, a choice other generations did not have before my atoning sacrifice. Therefore, whoever rejects me in the times of refreshing has the greater sin. My love for you is eternal and cannot be broken. My Father and I are one, and our purposes and designs are inseparable. The Father has given me all things that I might save some.
Take not your place among the faithless, as I have given you abounding reasons for great faith. The faith of a grain of mustard seed is all you need, just the slightest trust. Clothe yourselves in the clothes I have given you. Have I not poured out my spirit on you, oh, my doubters? Be not faithless but only believe, as the times and seasons are on you and there is no turning back. The world you once knew will never return, and the world you know today is one of great deception. Though things still appear familiar to you, all you once held dear has been taken by the evil one; for he has an appointed hour, an hour that had I not

shortened, no flesh would be left alive. Why do you desire the day of the Lord that is coming on the world to test the hearts of men? It’s a day of darkness where no man can stand. It’s a terrible day of judgment and consequence, and even in the darkest days, whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved.
Times and seasons are changing before your very eyes, and still you do not believe your own eyes. Though I do signs and miracles in you and among you, you still slam your eyes closed and stop your ears in faithless reasoning. My grace and mercy are everlasting from generation to generation, but the times are changing, and judgment and calamity are approaching the world you love so very much, and the things you hold dear will run through your fingers like sand. Soon the world will no longer have an invitation of grace and mercy, but those who will be saved will have to endure until their last breath to be saved in me. Turn to me and accept my invitation, for to be in Christ is to have a saving relationship with me, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings. You are the only one who can stop your salvation by turning away from me in unbelief and refusing my call. Consider Esau, who sold his birthright for a morsel of bread that was cast out in the draught, who gave away his inheritance to his brother in faithless unbelief. To ignore my words and walk in darkness is sin, so sin not and stand before me.
Why do you yet count yourselves unworthy of my grace, when all you have to do is accept? Accept my atoning works in your lives and allow me entrance to help you in your time of need, if only your faithless hearts would allow me. Choose life, for today is the time of choosing; hear my voice and harden not your hearts in the wilderness as the fathers did and fell by the wayside. Do not fall away from me; do not follow destruction and pernicious ways of faithless unbelief, but look to me and trust my voice. Yea, my sheep hear my voice, so follow me to safety. Think not that a heart of unbelief can stand sanctified before me, for unbelief is the rejection of the faith that I have given you in me.
Consecrate me, the Lord Jesus Christ, in your hearts and fear not, for my appearing is at hand and is very, very close. Trust my voice and walk in my footsteps, for the path I have laid for you leads to newness of life in the very presence of God. For I am the only way to God; I am the way, the truth, and the life. Though the evil one promises many things, he can deliver nothing, and he cannot deliver himself from my hand. No, great wrath is treasured against him, and Satan has an inheritance coming of his own choosing in that burning lake. All who choose him, all who take his mark, all who worship the beast and his image will follow him in his inheritance of the unending wrath of God.
Is my Father not justified in defending his creation? Is he not justified in his judgments and ways that he has laid before you? Therefore, choose life and choose the inheritance I have given you, for I promise a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteousness. I promise you life eternal, a life of great abundance, peace, and happiness. Yet, in your lack of faith, you still resist. What have I done to you to offend you that you refuse a relationship with me, the son of God, and with the Father of glory? To choose this world and its ways is to chose death, and eventually everyone’s choice will be final, as the times of separation are here; and those who don’t decide, a decision will be made for them.
There is no pleasure in the coming destruction that will soon overtake your world. Natural disasters will abound, and the earth shall quake, and great waves will crash on Mystery Babylon; for the earth will be ripped apart in many places. Great fire will overtake the land, and the merchants will stand afar off for fear of her torment. Great destruction is on the harlot, Babylon the great, who has made the world drunk with

her adulteries and fornications, for she has had many lovers. Those who will not separate themselves from her will share in her judgment, so why would you yet choose death over the life I have given you, paid for in my own sinless blood? War is about to come fully on your land and nation, and even though it is already underway – yes, an undeclared war they fight against you – soon it will break across the entire world as the seals are loosed.
Great war and great persecution will come over the earth as they will try to destroy anything of God and his Christ as they will eventually openly declare holy war on you. They will capture many, and many will be taken, and those who will be saved will have but one choice: endure to the end and love not their lives until the end and call on my name till the end. Your own leaders have betrayed you and will sacrifice many to the wicked one in the battles that will soon rage. Your nation will be attacked from within and from without. The red armies are already here, and they await their orders; for they plan a surprise attack, and many will be taken. The armies of the evil one will take everything from the land for their own and from those who reject me. They will steal your land, your homes, your posterity; and many lives will be lost in unbelief. War is coming from without as many nations are aligned against you; and they have your leaders’ consent, and your leaders work for your deaths. They want a world of their own, a world dedicated to Satan where they can fully follow the evils that dwell in them, and nothing will restrain their evil desires, as the restrainer will be gone.
They will utterly burn Secret Babylon with fire, and whoever does not succumb to the flames will succumb to famine; whoever does not succumb to famine will succumb to pestilence; whoever does not succumb to the edge of the sword will be delivered to the gallows for my name, and many will be beheaded as my Holy Word declares. And those who are martyred for my name will have great reward, and I will wipe all tears from their eyes.
Know, my children, that all delicacies and pleasures of sin that evil men treasure to themselves will but vanish into thin air, and tribulation and anguish will stand in their places. Darkness will cover the land, and there will be a dearth of my Word, and the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom will not be heard in her anymore.
Even then, I will send my prophets among you, as I will seal a number from the remaining tribes to minister to those, and great miracles will they do. Many signs and wonders will be granted during these days of darkness, and those who call on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved. Your towers will fall. Your bridges will collapse. Famine will break on the land, and there will be utter lawlessness, and they will hunt those who stand for me, and many will be martyred; yet great reward is prepared for those who stand till the end. Why do you desire the day of the Lord? For it would destroy all flesh from the earth had I not shortened the days. Then the world will see me break forth from the heavens with the armies in heaven, for the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof.
Yea, I tell you these things before they happen, not that you would stand there in unbelief, but that you would have just the faith as a grain of mustard seed, for it will grow fuller than the other trees and will become unshakable in me if you will allow me to purge your sins and if you will but come to me for healing and refreshing. The trumpet’s call is ever close and is nearly on you, and I will snatch my bride from the midst. I will yet set a place at my table for anyone who will make me Lord by answering their doors; for behold, I stand and knock!

Look to Me, the Lord Jesus Christ!
MARCH 28, 2024
My children, open your eyes and look to me, the Lord Jesus Christ. Awake out of sleep and return to me; return to me, for my arms are outstretched to you, my chosen. Soon you will be with me, as the hour is down to the last minute and the times of grace are nearly completed, and I will bring it to full consummation. Awake out of sleep, and I will break the enchantments of this world’s spells from your very eyes. Weep and howl over your sins and your refusal to come to me, and know that I am calling you at this last minute. I am calling you back to me, your first love, though you have taken others into your heart.
Run from them all, as they are imposters; yea, wolves in sheep’s clothing they are, and you have fallen asleep in their wicked embrace. Slumber not, my children, but awake and watch for me, as my signs are already in the skies and I come as a thief in the night. What will I find when I return for my Church? Will I even find faith? Oh, Laodicean church, you are lukewarm, and I would that you were cold or hot. Turn to me yet again, and I will cleanse you from your sleep, and I will soothe the wounds inflicted on you by the evil ones. I have no desire to spew you out of my mouth, so come yet again to me, and I will receive you. Know that my love for you is undying and is always strong and unchanging.
There is none but me who can save you, none but me who can make you whole and heal you, none but me who can protect you and give you life eternal, none but me who can save you from your sins, because there is no other name given whereby men can be saved. I am your eternal hope who has created you anew in my new birth that I have poured out onto you. Know that you are my Father’s children, and you have a mighty inheritance for your faithfulness. Yet, though I will judge your works for reward or loss, you have passed from unrighteousness into life eternal by your faith in me and my eternal Lordship. Behold! I have made you kings and priests before my Father, for I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
Who is he that would array himself against you? For to come against my brethren is to come against me, and I will repay, says the great eternal Lord of glory from on high! All things in heaven and earth are given into my hands, so know that I have supreme authority, and no one is greater than me except my Father, who has elevated me above all. So who is he that you should fear him? Doesn’t persecution and tribulation cause you to become stronger in me? Is it not so that when your own power fails you, I am right there to strengthen you in your weakness?
So stand strong and be mighty in me! Why do you doubt my words? But instead, have faith in me and speak the words I give you, for these words are mighty and powerful if you will but speak them in faith. Speak in confidence and authority, and command the beggarly elements in the name of Jesus Christ, my mighty name above all. Soon you will see me with your own eyes, and your presence in heaven is greatly desired by me and my Father, yea, even by Yeshua and Yahweh. You are my Father’s greatest treasure, and you are priceless. For where else is sinless blood given for your sins except in me?
Oh, you wicked ones who sit and gloat, thinking you have great victory. I will disrupt your plans of evil, and you will be able to accomplish only what my Father has determined you can do in accordance to further his own plans. You are weak and beggarly and utterly defeated. Oh, natural man, why do you yet choose

the wicked ways of the wicked ones who wickedly lead you astray? Are the pleasures of sin worth eternal separation from the glory of the eternal God? Where will you find life outside of me? Who will rescue you except the one you still reject? Hasn’t my grace and mercy even held back the hand of the enemy?
Anything good you have has descended from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning. But no, you have rejected my grace and used my mercy to revel and bask in your iniquities. Behold! Great destruction shall overtake you. You have been betrayed by your own leaders, who plot your destruction and have allowed the red armies entrance. Destruction and great evil will come on you suddenly, and it will come just as I snatch my bride from the midst of your evil ways. Then sudden destruction will ensnare you, for what fowler sets the snare in the bird’s sight? No, a thinly veiled trap is ready to spring, and it will happen as my restrainer is removed, and you will not escape.
Then your hearts will melt within you and your strength will flee as you see with your own eyes the creatures about to be unleashed from the depths of the earth onto you. I will open the abyss, for I even have authority over it; for I have the keys to death and hell, and no one can snatch them from me. Had you only understood that you own nothing on the earth, and all is but a gift of grace and mercy, because the love of God leads men to repentance. But no, you greedily hoard God’s goodness to yourselves and slay your neighbor instead of loving them as yourselves, as I have commanded. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, Jesus the Nazarene, to reconcile you to him in love through me.
But in your arrogance and worldly ways, you have hardened your hearts against me and my salvation. Therefore, utter destruction will come upon your nation in one hour, and Mystery Babylon shall be no more. Yea, Babylon the great, your secrets will be yet exposed for all to see, and those who cling to you will suffer the same judgment.
Therefore, oh, God-rejecting man, humble yourself and come to me now! Your hour of need is now. Turn to me; I’m begging you, and I’m calling you by name! Come out from this dying world, for there is salvation in me if you will but accept.
I have no pleasure in your judgment, and my Father desires you to live before him, and in his love he has given his creations a choice: I set before you this day life and death, therefore, choose life that both you and your seed may live! So come to me before it is too late and know that this evil world you cling to will be utterly destroyed, and it will happen through the wrath of the Lamb. Shall God not judge evildoers who have killed his children, who have maimed and abused the innocent, who have killed the only begotten son of God? Though I gave my life willingly for you and no man took my life, there is great judgment and justice to be served by me. For I purchased the earth in my blood and atoning sacrifice, and it is mine. I will set up a kingdom of righteousness and true holiness, where the lion and lamb shall lie down together, where no evil thing shall enter. Therefore, come out your of your sins, as I love you, and I am calling with my last breath before the last grain of sand drops. And it is almost here.

I am your eternal hope who has created you anew in my new birth that I have poured out onto you. I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. I am right here to strengthen you in your weakness. I am calling with my last breath before the last grain of sand drops, and it is almost here. I am that I am, and the Great I AM has sent me.

Have Faith in Me
MARCH 25, 2024
Hear my voice, my children, and have faith in me, the Lord Jesus Christ. I have called you to glory and virtue and to stand before me purified from your ways in my atoning blood, for the blood of the lamb washes all impurities away. You are cleansed in me. Know, my children, that there is no condemnation to them which are in me, that is, in Christ. To be united with me and my purposes is to come into communion with the Father, Yahweh, and me, his son Yeshua. I am the Lord who has called you by name and given you an invitation to eternal life where there will be no more trouble, nor anguish, nor sadness; for I will wipe away all tears from your eyes in my salvation for you. Will I start a work and not finish it? Will the God of heaven and earth leave something undone or default on his promises and word? Have you not read, it is impossible for God to lie? Verily, every promise will come to pass and be fulfilled, so know that your redemption draws near – not a partial redemption, but a full redemption with nothing left undone and nothing incomplete.
All of these things have been fulfilled, and the impossible has happened in me because I defeated death to die no more. Know that every evil work that Satan has tried to build in your lives I will undo. Yea, I will destroy all the works of the Devil; for this purpose was I made manifest. I have given you wholeness, and I will yet heal you to the uttermost from your corrupted bodies, and you will be like me. Check my Word, hear my Words, compare them with Scripture, and know that your full redemption is as close as your next breath and will happen instantly. Stand firm for me; speak for me. Have nothing to do with the idolaters and adulterers who have infiltrated my Church and who would endeavor to lead my little ones astray. My wrath abides on them and on anyone who attacks my people to lead them astray.
For it is impossible that you should be plucked from my hand, and those I have shown mercy to are those who have made me their Lord by confessing my mighty name, Jesus Christ, as Lord. I will not disappoint, and it has not entered into the heart of man the things that are waiting on you, as I will catch you away soon. Do not let evil words trouble your hearts, my children, as you are saved from the wrath of God, and my faithful will not endure the seven-year period of wrath that is about to be unleashed. Let your hearts be at peace and rest in me, even in your tribulation and persecution rest in me, and I will give you indescribable peace. My mercy and grace endures forever, and I have paid the price for your sins, so continue to come out of them. I see the turmoil you endure. I hear all the harsh words spoken to you and about you. Furthermore, I strengthen you in your weakness, and I have given you of my spirit, and you are mighty and powerful in me. In your own strength you will fail, so rest in my strength, for my Father has exalted me above all else.
I will take vengeance on the wicked very soon, my children, so fear not. This vengeance is not for you, and it is not intended for God’s children but for his enemies who have wronged mankind and for evil men who murder and plunder their neighbor and brother.
Yea, many evil men have joined Satan for greedy gain, and they have their portion and reward in the lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. Are you not all one race, the human race? Yet, know that great wrath is about to be unleashed and heaven is about to be revealed to the earth. Every deed is recorded.

Every idle word spoken has been written down. There is no secret that can be kept from me, and there is nowhere to hide from my gaze. Though the wicked tunnel into the earth to escape my approaching wrath, they will meet their end trying to hide from me.
I will repay, and I will take vengeance and establish justice for the wronged. I have a sharp two-edged sword proceeding from my mouth, and nothing and nobody can stop me, as I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Who can separate you from the love of God that is in me? I did not pay for your sins and give you life eternal to unleash wrath and condemnation on you, my faithful. Nothing and nobody can separate us, and soon you will look on my Father and me with your own eyes. Though you have built great trust and faith in me, never having seen me with your own eyes, soon you will see, and you will know as you are known. Who is he that troubles you? Will he not come to nothing and his evil works returned to him double? Evil men have treasured up great wrath, yea, great wrath for abusing my Father’s creation, and I will repay, saith the Lord.
Stand before me and continue to separate yourself from this evil, dying world and allow my atoning work to wash over you, cleansing you to the uttermost. Behold! I make all things new, and your sins and iniquities I will remember no more. So come out of your own works and take up my works, for in so doing you will bring wholeness to your own souls. Fear not the wicked! For soon their works will disperse as dust before a great wind, and I will make all things clean and new. There is great reward for my faithful and chosen; and soon, yea, very soon you will reap the rewards for your works if you faint not.
Stand for me to the very end, as he who loses his life in me shall find life and will reap great joy and salvation and rejoicing forevermore before my Father. I have made you kings and priests before my Father, as I am the eternal high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Stand firm in my grace and know that very soon the door shall close, just as God shut Noah and his treasures inside the Ark. So too will I assemble you unto myself in the heavens. There is an open door that no man can open or close, and I will receive you to myself, my Bride. So watch for me as time is nearly up.
I am the faithful Lord.
I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am the head of the body.
I am the bridegroom to the bride, and I say come!
I am he who dies no more, for it is impossible that death should hold me.
I am he who has called you to glory, virtue, and truth.
I am the Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God manifest in the flesh who has died for your sins.
I am he that has been resurrected the third day to die no more.
I am he that God has received into the heavens as my apostles and disciples watched me go into the clouds.
I am the eternal high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.

Wait for Me a Little Longer: I Will Not Tarry
MARCH 23, 2024
Wait for me a little longer, my children, and I will not tarry. I will never leave you nor forsake you, for you are the apple of my Father’s eye and the very apple of my own eye. You are my Bride, and what bridegroom leaves his bride to the judgment of sinners?
Know that I, the Lord Jesus Christ, will rescue my people. Have you not read in Holy Scripture? Did my Father not snatch Enoch to the heavens? Did my Father not snatch Elijah to the heavens? Did my Father not deliver the children of Israel from Egypt? Did he not deliver Lot from Sodom before fire fell on those cities, destroying them all? How much more will I deliver my bride that I have purchased with my own blood from the hands of judgment that is about to pass on this world? How long will you attribute folly to me, your Lord, and to my Father, your God?
I have given you eternal life, and there is great reward treasured for the faithful in heaven, so fear not, as your inheritance is about to be realized. I am the righteous Shepherd who saves the flock from the ravenous wolves. These same wolves will soon hear, “Depart from me, you workers of iniquity; I never knew you, though you say, Lord, Lord!” I am the faithful Shepherd who has lost none the Father has given me, but the son of perdition who betrayed me for thirty pieces of silver and scripture was indeed fulfilled by his transgression and refusal. What lessons are therein for you, my children, except you cannot be lost from my hand and none is able to seize you from me?
Fear not the judgment of evildoers, my faithful ones, and know that your Father’s wrath will not touch you. What father amongst you would give just one of his children into the hands of the enemy? Though this is a common sin amongst the men of earth, there is no shadow of turning for the Father of lights! So fear not and be at peace. Cease from your own works and rest in me. Pursue my works and enjoy rest in me, the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself as a sacrifice for the sins of all once and forever.
Oh, you children of the earth, your sins are before me, and you have treasured up great wrath and judgment against yourselves! Instead of treasuring an inheritance of blessings, you have treasured wrath against wrath for this great day that is about to overtake you. Oh, your idle words you have spoken, saying, “Where is the Lord; he is but a myth who never was and tomorrow will be the same as today and yesterday.” Your judgment will overtake you suddenly, and events will move so fast that you will be lost in suffering. Your evil words and evil ways will bring great destruction on you in an instant. All you hold dear will be taken from you, and all your treasures will vanish from your hands as I have given them into the hands of those who hate you, for you have hated me without cause.
The wrath of the Lamb is about to be delivered upon you, and the birth pangs are closer together now, so close that you mistake them for the wrath of the Lamb. Know, oh, foolish man, that in my long-suffering I am warning you of your own demise, and still you scoff in unbelief. Very soon I will remove the restrainer from your midst, and I will remove my Bride from your midst, and utter destruction will come on you suddenly. Satan has moved his armies and his pieces in place, ready to unleash his full anger and wrath on you, and I have given you into his hands. Your great nation is crossed out and marked for utter destruction;

oh, that you understood the words, Mystery Babylon. Yet there is still time to repent, but most of you will not in your stubborn heard-hearted ways of heretical rebellion.
Your judgment will come on you in two major ways: from within and from without. The great whore will be rent in pieces; she shall be consumed in water and burnt with fire and covered over in pestilence and famine. Yea, oh, earthly man, who will deliver you from my hand? No one is coming to save you. Your destruction is imminent. The red armies walked into your nation right under your nose, and you could not have cared less as long as you were entertained and fat with temporal wealth that was never yours to begin with, for the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof. Not only have you sealed your own destruction, but you have sold out your children and grandchildren to utter destruction, and still you scoff. Your posterity is lost. You will not scoff much longer as all of your evil and perverted ways will engulf you in misery, torment, and destruction, though a great multitude will be purified through tribulation.
All those who turn to me and call on my name and love not their lives to the end, I will reward eternally! Never will they suffer again, but your suffering will never end, oh, evil ones. But you, oh, God-rejecting natural man, who declared war against your Creator and lusted after rebellion against me and my ways. Your destruction will come suddenly and without relief. You have become a nation of whores, and how appropriate that your nations are referenced as a harlot in Holy Scripture. The armies will consume what’s left of your once great and mighty nation, and a great cleansing will come over the land, and great punishment will consume you on account of your evil ways.
I have taken everything from you on account of your rebellious and hard-hearted ways; and though I paid for your sins, you have rejected my offer, choosing instead to pay for them yourselves, and you will regret it for all eternity. When the restrainer is lifted, instant destruction will be your companion; and you have sacrificed your children to the same fate as you, though many will be saved. Even some of your children will turn to me, and I will receive them into glory, though you kept them from me, and you will go into perdition in that great lake that awaits the Devil and his angels.
My little children, fear not. Continue to stand faithful for me here in this last minute, yea, your last minute in this dying world. I have called you, I have chosen you, I have hand-picked you on account of your love for me and your faithfulness, and great treasures await you in my Father’s house. You will be taken to safety and great reward; though some will suffer loss, all of my chosen ones shall be saved fully and to the uttermost.
Focus on me, commune with me; I am nearer than your next breath. Know, my chosen, that I do fight for you; and though persecution and tribulation abound, you will be saved from wrath. Therefore, purify yourselves by coming out of this world and rejecting her evil ways. Wash your hands of her sins and depart from her iniquities, for anyone in the harlot’s bed will suffer anguish. Cleanse yourselves in my atoning blood and wash yourselves fully. Behold, I have sealed you with my Father’s seal, and I will fully redeem and re-create you after my own image. Yea, you will be a new man and are a new creation in me, and soon there will be a new heaven and a new earth, for my Father is making all things new. So stand fast and know that my love is a burning fire, and you are greatly treasured and longed for. Soon you will be with me.

Hear My Words, Says the Lord!
MARCH 20, 2024
Hear my words, says the Lord! The day of the Lord is about to break upon you like an all-consuming fire, and by fire shall the sins of many be purged who will call on my name and love not their lives till the end. My sheep hear my voice, and I will provide a way for them, even though they will experience many troubles. Those who hold to my mighty name shall be saved, as even so yet by fire. The enemy is upon you, oh, arrogant ones who have rejected the peace I offered you. Your sins have come before me and great judgment is upon you. Though my fire shall not consume my little ones, and the times will be the most difficult ever, many saints shall escape the second death by turning to my name in their hour of trouble and by standing firm until the very end. I, the Lord Jesus Christ, have spoken it and sent warning to those with ears to hear and eyes to see.
Oh, you nations, you idolatrous nations who traffic in great sins. Yea, you have become merchants of evil who glorify the evil one with all your evil words and evil ways that you have learned to your own demise. You have become traffickers in flesh and humans, for even children have become your merchandise. The wrath of the Lamb, yea, my wrath will consume your world, and my fire will cleanse the land from the works of evildoers. Before my kingdom shall come, a great cleansing shall overtake the earth, and the earth shall be stained by the blood of evildoers. Yet, I will build my kingdom on the earth, a kingdom of righteousness and peace where no evil thing shall enter, and I will rule the nations with a rod of iron.
What currently is will be destroyed and will not be rebuilt, and I will utterly cast down your idols, and the high places of your mind shall be brought low. For you have said in your heart, “I am no widow!” Yet your desolation will come over you in one hour, and it will utterly engulf and reshape the world as you have known it. Why do you worship your own death, oh, idolaters of the earth? Why do you set apart and sanctify your own punishment that you have heaped against your own souls? Have you not seen? Have you not heard? Have you not read? No, you are blind, and you are deaf, and you cannot comprehend my words because you have rejected my holy spirit that I would send over you and utterly cleanse you before me if you would only accept my offer.
I will repay, says the Lord. I will repay every man according to his works, and I will give a double portion of judgment as I return your works to the detriment of your own souls, and you will not recover. Judgment is about to break forth on the earth, and so many of you still ignore my call and do not heed my words that would surely save you from your calamity. The hour of your judgment is approaching, and many will take the mark, thinking they can save their own necks and live in the sins they love yet a little while longer. The son of perdition will promise many things and will deceive the entire earth as they wonder after the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast?”
Yet, the coming evil one, with his lying signs and wonders, will betray you, and you will perish utterly. You will die in your sins and wake up to the great white throne judgment where you will answer for every sin, for every evil thought, yea, for every idle word shall you give an account. And in your own filthy rags you will be found wanting, and you will not stand upright, because no flesh is upright in his sight, but all have

gone astray and worshiped their own corruption. Oh, man, anyone who rejects me and who rejects their Creator shall utterly perish without remedy. Now is the time of salvation. Whom will you run to when you are taken captive and cast alive into the lake of fire? Your pillow will be fiery brimstone, and your covers will be the eternal flames my Father has prepared for the Devil and his angels. Yet, by rejecting me, you have chosen your own fate and joined the evil one, and you will share in his judgment.
I, the Lord Jesus Christ, who was made flesh and dwelt among you, verily, I will utterly destroy the enemy’s kingdom, and the earth will become the final battlefield. Escape while you can because time is almost up! Only a few grains of sand remain to fall through the hourglass, and the trumpet shall sound. As my Church is snatched away and my bride is taken to her chambers, Satan and his host will be cast into the earth, and he will utterly wage war on the inhabitants of the earth. The abyss will be opened, and many foul creatures will ascend in pursuit of anything they can devour. Oh, foolish man, do you not understand that in my grace and mercy I have restrained the fullness of the enemy’s kingdom from coming on you?
Yet, I will give you what you long for in your sinful desires, and I will unleash his entire kingdom against you, and you will utterly be given into the hands of your enemies. His goal is to destroy all mankind to the last soul, for he wants a godless world for himself, which he shall never have. Had I not shortened the days, he would succeed, and no flesh would be left alive! Yet, you still prefer your sins over the deliverance, love, and light I have for you if you but only choose life and confess my name as Lord! Yea, make me, Jesus Christ, your Lord, as I am alive evermore as a beacon to those who are about to perish. Those who call on my name shall be saved.
My little children, time is almost over. I know that many of you are weary and are vexed to the core of your souls by the evil that has sprung up around you. These are the last few minutes of the birth pangs, and my chosen shall be delivered into the heavens, where I have provided a place of safety where they may take refuge. My reward is in my hand for the faithful and even the unfaithful, who shall suffer loss but will still be saved alive for eternity because they have made me their Lord. Therefore, depart from your sins and look to me, so that I may shine my light into your heart and you may cleanse yourselves by my atoning blood. Shrink not from the times and shrink not from the work that remains for you, for the time is at hand.
As events unfold in front of your eyes, know that these same events will accelerate and things will happen very quickly, for judgment slumbers not. The times of grace and the times of refreshing for my Church are coming to a close. Truly, I have not been slack concerning the promises but have showed great longsuffering and patience that every last soul whom I have chosen will come to me. Judgment is upon you, oh, earth, and only the faithful in my Church shall escape. Why do you still let deceivers and false prophets trouble you by their troubling words that they speak against the simplicity found in me? Why would you let them entice you away from my marriage to my bride when I would prepare you a seat at the table if you would only come out of your sins and believe the actual words in my Holy Word?

Stand Strong and Purify Yourselves
MARCH 18, 2024
The faithful Lord says to his chosen and faithful: Stand strong and purify yourselves by putting down and confessing your sins. Come out of her, my people, and be separate from her sins so that you don’t share in her judgment and plagues. Who is she you ask? Is she not Babylon the Great, whose judgment has come? Is she not the great whore who is drunken on the blood of the saints? Safety and peace will I provide you, and I will lead you to shelter in my Father’s house until the season is over.
I am the Lord Jesus Christ, who has called you to glory and virtue, so faint not in well doing. I have given you a voice to speak for me and announce my soon arrival. Yet many in my Church have lost their voice and have become faithless in their expectation that my Father placed for you in his Word. Be not faithless but only believe. Look for the signs of my coming, as my Father has declared it in the heavens and they are already well known. Why are you still yet slow to believe? Have trust in me, my children, for I succor you; yea, I prune every branch from you that bears not fruit. Have confidence in my Lordship for you and push into my salvation as you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Turn to me in prayer and ask me to show your sins to you so that you may confess them to me and overcome them by my blood. So fear not, for your salvation is near; yea, the second hand has almost completed its last rotation in my age of grace.
Turn to me and come to me as I have readied a place at my table for you and I have prepared shelter for you in my Father’s house to escape the coming tsunami of disasters. They approach those who dwell on the earth, and great judgment is about to fall across the earth. Forsake not my name! I know you are weary in this last hour, but rest in me and find energy in me and proclaim my soon arrival. I have not given a day or time for you to watch for, as you would build your entire lives around the event. But have no illusions: the date and hour are known in the heavens at this point, and my angels are on the ready, waiting for the trumpet blast when I will gather those who sleep in the earth first, and those who are alive and remain shall join them to meet me in the air, and I will take you to your inheritance that the Father has hid in me. Only faint not.
It will happen in the twinkle of an eye, when many of you will be about your day, and instantly you will stand before me as I present you to my Father; and we long for that day as we both long for your presence. I could indeed appear and preach to many, and who is to say that I have not done just that at times? Will you declare what the Lord can do? Or will you limit my abilities and Lordship by your lack of faith? Impossible! However, I have made you my fellow workers and included you in the work my Father gave me to accomplish, and know that it is an honor and a joy that I’ve bestowed on you for your salvation, reward, and wholeness.
As you have ministered to others in my name, have I not ministered to you? Give freely and hoard not the knowledge of my coming, though many will resist and you will be counted as lunatic. The lies of the enemy will melt before your power-filled words as you but speak for me and announce my appearing and herald the coming judgment, as even in these last seconds some will come to salvation. Many are not ready yet

and will refuse your words; love them anyhow, as a great multitude will be saved out of great trials and tribulation, and know that your words can serve as a beacon of light and hope for the trials they may face.
Oh, dwellers on the earth who have refused my call and counted yourselves unworthy for my gift of salvation and all it brings: Great judgment is pronounced on the earth and it is nearly upon you, though you lie to yourselves, saying, “I have great plans for myself and tomorrow will be the same as today!” You fool! You do not even understand the turning of the seasons, as the skies herald the wedding of my bride to me in the heavens, and the skies turn from grace to judgment right before your eyes. Great calamity will come on you shortly, and many will die in their sins. It is not my will that you perish, but you reject my sinless sacrifice for you that could have saved you to the uttermost.
The world you know today will vanish before your eyes, and all the pleasures of sin in this life will no longer be your companions; but you will be pursued and hunted by an army of your enemies that lust for your demise and long for your possessions. There will be great shaking under your feet, and the earth will cleave, and many will fall into the earth. Your leaders have already betrayed you, though you foolishly still look to them, trying to figure out your vote. Your towers will fall, and your bridges will collapse, and your infrastructure will disappear before your eyes, and nothing will be the same.
Where will you run to when you have rejected the holy Lord, me, the Lord Jesus Christ? Who will save you now from your time of judgment? Oh, but you say, I am unworthy of judgment, whatever do you mean? Have you not rejected your Creator when he has sent me to you for your saving grace, a saving grace you count yourselves unworthy to obtain? Why have you rejected me? What offense have I done to you? I gave my last drop of blood in great torment and agony that you might live before me, yet you still do not believe my witnesses whom I have sent in my name.
Even in warning you of your approaching calamity, neither I nor my Father have any pleasure in what is about to be unleashed. But as you have been entertained by sin, you will now be swallowed alive by the consequences you have treasured for yourselves. As you have lusted after money, property, and financial acclaim, you have done nothing more than heap wrath onto your own dinner table, and you will dine on tribulation and anguish. I will give you the darkness you love so much. Darkness will fall on your land and will envelope the earth, a darkness so thick that the noon sun shall appear to have been extinguished. You say to me, what sin do I have to bring your wrath; have we not done many mighty works in your name?
Verily, you have done many works, but they are not the works I have given you; no, you have become a false prophet, prophesying words from your twisted flesh. No, you do your own works for your own glory, as you have made your belly your god. You hold the good words and fair speeches of evil men above my holy Word. Am I not the Word made flesh? You could have eaten of me the bread of life and escaped perdition, never to hunger again. You could have drank of the rivers of living waters flowing from me; yea, you could have drank of my spirit and never thirsted again. But in your refusal of me, you will go into great famine and distress, though to this very minute you still think it will not come upon you in an instant. Your economy is destroyed, and the riches you have lusted after will be worthless instantly. You have placed your faith in the rulers of this present darkness and have cherished the lies of Satan over the light of my ever-present truth.
Therefore, you will seek a place at their table, only to discover there is no place set for you. They will have great plenty that they have hoarded for themselves, and you will have access only by taking the mark of the beast. Even though the beast has not quite been revealed in his time, I have warned of him and identified

him to my faithful so that they are not deceived by his good words and fair speeches, even though at this time he has no kingdom, at least not yet. Take not his mark, as all who do will have their portion alongside the beast and false prophet in the lake of fire, and the smoke of their torment will forever rise.
You have been warned, and though I still seek to deliver you from your destruction, you still stubbornly refuse my call. Therefore, I will give you the fruit of your own ways.
You will experience great famine, great war, great destruction. The red armies will pursue, torment, and destroy many of you; and it will come to pass that you will be surrounded by dangers and destruction. He who is not taken captive into torment and eventual death will fall by the sword; he who does not fall by the sword will meet the wild beasts, who will kill many; he who does not perish by the wild beasts will succumb to famine, and the ways of death shall be multiplied on the land.
Great tribulation, calamity, destruction will come to you instantly, and mighty waves of the sea will come upon your nation. A mighty nation shall you never be again, yet a remnant will still be saved. Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, but he who loves his life to the end will have his part in the lake of fire, and you will share in Satan’s torment and punishment because you have held to his dying world to your last stubborn breath, and you will certainly perish with this dying world. Turn to me while there is still yet time so that I may save you and your families from the coming calamity. Just as a multitude received salvation on the day of Pentecost many years ago in the first few minutes of this age, so too shall a multitude be saved in the last few minutes of this age, and my invitation still stands for a very short time longer.
The evil that is coming will not respect women or children or the elderly or the infirm. No, that evil will consume all it can into great perdition and agony. Run to me while there is still yet time, as the clock is almost ready to stop, and there will be time no more. Satan will be cast into the earth shortly, and his kingdom will be unleashed to the fullest on your world, and he has great wrath because he knows he has but a short time. Turn to me while you still can to escape the coming evil.
I am the Lord of Lords and King of Kings.
I am he that walks amongst the seven lampstands and commands the seven angels of the seven churches.
I am he that commands the armies of heaven, as my Father has put their command in my hands.
I am the Word made flesh who dwelt among you.
I am the root of Jesse, and my kingdom has no end.
I am the son of God come in the flesh to atone for the sins of all, if only all would accept.
Those who have accepted my grace and have been faithful will rule with me in my kingdom and partake of my throne, as I have made you kings and priests before our God. There is great reward for you treasured in the heavens; only stand firm and faithful just a few minutes more.

The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof: Though the usurper and thief have set his claim, he can only do what my Father has given for his hand to accomplish in his holy plan of redemption for mankind. Fear him not! He must continue for a season, as his hour has come; but fear him not, my righteous, faithful ones; fear him not! Have I not given you victory over him? Jacob’s trouble is not for my faithful, and the ones who have come to me in the times of refreshing shall be highly exalted in the very throne room of God. Yea, my faithful people, great reward is treasured up for you on account of your faithfulness that you have faithfully shown toward me.
I have made you kings and priests to me in my coming Kingdom and before our Father, so stand fast, my children, in these final minutes of the final hour. My appearing is at hand, and your redemption is as near as your next breath, so stand faithful before me, knowing that I am your strength and salvation and you are sealed in me, as I have purchased you with my blood as I gave my life for you that you may be reconciled in love to our Father in heaven. I long for the day, and our Father longs for the day, when you stand before him in the bodies I have for you in your full redemption, and there will be no more a curse on my chosen.
Oh, man, who are you to stake a claim on my inheritance? Know you not that I purchased the earth and all therein with my own sinless blood? The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, and righteousness is coming to the earth! Though you would destroy the earth and make it a desolate habitation for your abominable abominations, though you would swear fidelity to my eternal enemy and seek your own torment for temporal base gain, you understand not that you make war against your own souls as you treasure up wrath against the day of wrath, when I shall reward every man according to his works.
Oh, foolish man, you say to yourself that your gods will save you, when they have no reward for you, and you are deceived and deceiving others in your delusions. Your gods of stone cannot speak; your idols in your hearts cannot hear; they cannot save you, oh, idolatrous one! It would be better for you that you should have never been born, for the wrath of God abides on you for your hard-hearted ways. Though your mouth has become an open sepulcher, spewing great things against the Lord of Lords, your words will come home to you, and your evil desires shall be turned upon you in your coming eternal punishment. Oh, that you had turned to me and accepted salvation from your present fallen state. Oh, that you had simply confessed my name from your lying lips. But no, you have loved your lies, and you have loved your delusions, and you have sold your souls to eternal damnation for a morsel of bread that cannot sustain you; for I am the bread of life! Your calamity shall come on you suddenly and without remedy. I will rend your nation; I will destroy your commerce and economy; in an instant I will snatch your wealth from you; truly, I will strip all pleasure from you in an instant, and your poverty and misery will consume you. The wrath of the Lamb approaches, when my vengeance that my Father has given to me shall be executed, for I am worthy to open the books and loose the seals.
You have mistakenly assumed my long-suffering and patience for weakness and neglect. You have said in your hearts: Where is the Lord? He is but an ancient myth. We have learned so much more than the saving

ways of the Lord; in my knowledge, I am superior, for my technologies are mightier than some old book of contradictions and legends. Truly, many of you do not even believe that I ever came in the first place and shed my redeeming blood for the sins and salvation of mankind. It is better that you had not even been born, for the wrath you have treasured against your own soul will come upon you without remedy, and you will know full well your sins, and your utter misery and desolation will be your spouse. You will eat of your own filth, and your filthy ways will ever be with you, as you are buried in the fruits of wrath in your evil deeds that you have committed in great evil against my name. Depart from me; I know you not!
Who is he among you that falsely speaks in my name? You claim to know me, to represent me; some of you even think you can command me to do your very bidding and bring material gain to yourselves by your own good works, which are nothing more than filthy rags. How can you speak for me when you know me not? How can you speak for me when I have not given you the words? How can you speak for me to my people when I have not sent you? No, you have sent yourselves, peddling your corrupt wares for greedy base gain and for the adoration of men that you so desperately crave. You fool! Depart from me, as I never knew you!
You false prophets, who declare me Lord in name only; you false prophets, who speak great lies against your own souls; you shall utterly perish, and I will spew you out of my mouth. Therefore, repent! Return to me and I will return to you. Come out from among your idols and depart from your accursed cults and come to me and make me your Lord! Oh, that you would accept my salvation; yet you persist in your sins and excuse your own guilt as you quote my sacred Word from an empty heart, a heart full of adultery and fornication as you run to your idols. Who will save you from my wrath when you have led astray my people for your own base gain? Had you made me Lord as your lying mouths have declared, I would have saved you from your sins and made you whole in me. I would have pastored the hurts the evil one inflicts on you. I would have given you a path and a purpose and sent you on the earth with mouths full of blessings and truth as you would have led my people to me.
Think not that I need your help, as I am the true Lord of heaven and earth, and I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Those I have ordained in ministry are given a great honor to speak for me and care for my flock, an honor that I will reward with eternal treasures; yet, you have exchanged me for a false version of Christ. Another Jesus have you made for yourselves; you have loved the spirit of antichrist, and you have sinned eternally against your own souls by declaring me absent from my own Church that I purchased with my own blood, a sin you shall not recover from. Truly, all of these things and more will come on you in my wrath unless you humble yourselves before me and truly make me Lord by repenting in sackcloth and ashes. Do not rationalize away my words as you play semantics with my speech! Repent! Seat yourself in sackcloth and ashes and weep over your iniquities, and I will receive you to me and restore you to your reward that I would otherwise bestow on another.
I am the righteous Lord.
I am the savior of the world, even King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
I am he who walks among the seven lampstands and who commands the seven angels of the seven churches.
I am the lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world, and in me is life eternal.

I hold the keys to death and hell, and my Father has shared his throne with me, that I may share my throne with my faithful, called, and chosen. I walk with my people and I talk with my people, and I am the true shepherd who shepherds that flock my Father has given me. You are the apple of my eye, my faithful, and you are the apple of my Father’s eye, and for this time and hour have you been restored to righteousness and true holiness.
The hour approaches, and you should cease from your own works and watch for my appearing, for it is about to come on the world as I gather you from the four corners of the earth. Truly, truly, I will gather my true sheep into my barn before the storms come that will destroy this present evil world, for Satan’s kingdom will be torn asunder and totally destroyed to make way for the righteous Lord who will rule the earth from the throne of David in righteousness and true holiness, and I will greatly empower my bride in the coming kingdom, for they are my kings and priests, and they shall rule in true righteousness and holiness, for my reward is in my hand for the faithful.
I am your strength and salvation, and you are sealed in me.
I am the bread of life!
I am worthy to open the books and loose the seals.
I am the true lord of heaven and earth.

Something Wonderful
MARCH 15, 2024
The Word of the Lord is upon me, behold the word of the Lord!
Behold! I am doing something wonderful before you, and many of you refuse to see!
Behold! I am doing a mighty work in your midst that will soon consummate!
Behold! I am doing a mighty work in you, whereby you are saved and made whole!
I have done more than mend a few broken pieces. I have done more than mend you together again, where the seams and scars are present. I have made my chosen and faithful whole in me, the living Christ, and I have created you anew. Know that your lives are hidden in me, and when I appear, so shall you also appear with me in glory and will henceforth be with me forever. You are my bride and you are my body; have I not called you by name? Have I not made a path for you to return to your Father, the Father of lights?
I am he who was known by my Father before the world began, who was commissioned and born for your salvation, who was crucified, giving my last drop of blood for your sins. Nothing is left out and nothing is left undone, and what has been said will be performed and consummated to the uttermost. I have created you with my holy spirit that the Father gave to pour out on my apostles on that long-past day of Pentecost, when they spoke the wonderful works of God in tongues they themselves could not comprehend. I have called, and even though many have rejected me, a remnant of grace and election has responded, and I have done a mighty work in them that is soon to be revealed. Truly, when you look in the mirror, your true self you do not see. I have made you mighty in your weakness, and at the appearing so shall you appear. You will be like me, and you will evermore be with me. I am the firstfruits of the dead, and the harvest is nearly upon you. When I shall appear, you will rise to meet me, and you will be in my Father’s house as I snatch you away to your home in the heavens.
Truly, truly, in my holy Word (as I am the word made flesh who is holy and walks among you), yea, in my holy word, have you not read that judgment starts with the house of God? I am about to complete a work in my chosen, righteous, and elect, whereby you will be completely re-created in me and will be as I am, for you have been conformed to the image of the only begotten son of God. My reward is with me, and I will not judge you on account of your sins; have I not already paid for them? By your acceptance of my Lordship and your identification with me, you are forgiven and righteous in me, for I paid a terrible price that was not mine to pay as I am sinless. No, I took your sins, iniquities, sorceries, and wrath and punishment from you so that you may be united with the Father and with the Son. No, I will judge your works carried out on earth.
And with my judgment is great reward, and many works will survive that are gold, silver, and precious stones. Verily, the wood, hay, and stubble will but burn away as chaff, and you will experience loss, though you will be saved so as yet by fire. For my fire for you is a refiner’s fire, in which I have purified your souls as a goldsmith purifies his gold, removing the dross. Stand firm and be still in me. Who is he that should trouble you, though verily you are persecuted and endure tribulation? Fear not, they hated me and they

also hate you. Yet, in your redemption you will come to be greatly admired in the glory with which I will clothe you on that near and fast-approaching day. My Father longs to see you before him in his throne room, where your seats await you, for my Father has seated you in the heavenlies. Are you not his chosen, his ambassadors, his glory, crown, and prize of inestimable worth? Truly, you are priceless.
Judgment will fall on Babylon the Great shortly, and a terrible judgment it will be, but it is deserved. Oh, man, how long shall I endure you? You have gone from a nation of saints that served as a beacon to the world to come to me, to a nation of adulterous harlots. I have separated my people from you, and the separation is nearly consummated as this age of grace comes to a close. Oh, man, why do you follow the evil one, accepting his worthless bribes over me, the eternal Christ, in all my splendor and glory.
My Father gave time for all nations to repent, and many people, even a great multitude, have accepted my offer in my saving grace showered on them.
Yet you, oh, natural man who refuses the things of the spirit and despises his neighbor, will endure great judgment on your land, and Babylon the Great shall never be again. Babylon, you have become a nation of harlots who play the role with your skirts above your heads like a wild ass in heat waiting for the next passerby. You have defiled yourselves with strange flesh, you have relished and loved your sins, and eternal judgment will fall on all the hard-hearted who count my sacrifice but a light and worthless thing to behold. You have become a nation of evildoers and truce breakers who change wives like old garments for new until the new is soiled. Your great words you have spoken against my Father will be held to account. Your worthless imaginations will be laid in front of you, and you will give an account. But your account will never be enough to stand righteous before me. Your very existence has been corrupted, and in your insanity you have chosen your decaying flesh, for as my Father said, ye shall surely die. Yet, it still seems strange to you that in dying you shall die. Although your full expiration was not instant, you have been dying since the day of your first breath. Judgment has been declared on your nation, and do not the heavens shout the same? I will utterly destroy your land, and your great towers shall fall, and thick blackness shall cover the earth. Your walls are already breached, and millions have come for you to take from you what I have given them, because I will fatten the hand of your enemies in your judgment. Your time is nearly over, and you are a chained nation before me, waiting for my angels to come in judgment. You will fall greatly as the waters come on you, as the shaking comes on you, as the armies are unleashed, and your land shall be cleaved asunder. Famine shall settle over the world, and war will come to the entire world as the beast rises from the ashes in their long-planned schemes.
Time has been given for repentance, and many have answered in faith, the great mercy that I have given before judgment is executed. I have no pleasure in the coming destruction, but even now, many live in great sin, even preying on your own children, and you could not care less as long as your money is near. I will take all riches, delicacies, pleasure, and happiness from you. You will shrivel before the heavens, searching for a morsel of sustenance that many will not find. Yet, those who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
My little children, it is the last hour of the last time in this age of grace. I have sent my prophets in the work of my dear friend John the Baptist. Have they not become a voice crying in the wilderness? Are they not my shepherds, calling and searching for the last of my lost flock? Truly, I have another fold as well, and the time

of their salvation is at hand, as Jacob shall be saved and a remnant of Jacob will accept me as their Lord, as all the chosen become one new man. I have sent many across the earth, heralding my arrival. Though many of my people have been deceived and are lukewarm, my spirit shall awaken in many, and many shall return to me. My appearing is at hand. Stand strong and shout my arrival and shout my words of salvation to all. The time is almost at hand, and silence is on the deep as the hosts of heaven await the trumpet blast that is nearer than you can imagine. Yet, a very short time remains, and many more shall yet be saved, so faint not. I am he who pastors my church and has given gifts unto men. I am the great and mighty Lord, slain from the foundations of the world. I am he who gave his life for the flock, the living Christ whom God has raised from the dead. I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you. I am the only begotten son of God come in the flesh, even the mighty Messiah of the Israel of God. I am near, and my appearing is at hand. I am the righteous judge who is worthy to open the seals. I am the lamb of God, slain for the sins of my people. I am the sinless savior who saves to the uttermost. I am a man acquainted with much grief and sorrows, yet my joy remains full. I am the living Lord, the righteous shepherd. I am the one prophesied of by all the prophets and I have the keys to death and hell, and the Father has put
all things in heaven and earth into my mighty hands.

Hear My Voice!
MARCH 14, 2024
The Word of the Lord came upon me. Hear my voice, my little ones, and come to my outstretched arms. Know that my love for you is unbreakable and cannot be conquered, for it is the love of my Father in that he has given of his nature to his children, and in me all fullness dwells. I have called you by name and I have invited you to stand before me. My sheep hear my voice, as they know the voice of their shepherd. Do you not yet hear my voice? Have you closed your ears to my voice? I cry aloud in the streets and in the alley ways; I have even visited your prisons and brought salvation to the abused and forgotten.
Oh, man, why do you forsake your Lord? Why have you turned from my ways? Yet, you will say, I have not turned from your ways; I am he the Lord has called. Verily, I have called, and you did respond for a season, a season of youth with great excitement. Some of you were taken to where the wolves dwell, and many of you have been led astray through good words, fair speeches, and lying tongues that are soon to be stopped.
Remember your first love, and repent; confess your sins to me, as I am always ready to cleanse your sins in my atoning blood.
Hear my voice, my children, as many voices sound similar and many false Christs try to counterfeit my voice. Verily, I do care for and pastor my church with my own hand, that I may present you to God pure as a virgin and dressed in fine white linen, with the stains of your sins forgiven, removed, and forgotten as I have cast them into the deepest depths, never to rise again. Yet, many of you are distracted and even enchanted by this present evil world. They have attacked with their sorceries through the serpent’s bite, but understand that though a serpent bite you, no harm shall come to you, for my Father’s seal cannot be broken. Focus your attention on me, his only begotten son, whom he gave willingly to atone for your sins that we may be reunited, never to separate again. Let me heal you; let me heal you to the uttermost and remove your scars so that you are sound and whole before me. Follow my ways and follow my Word, for:
I am the Word made flesh who dwells amongst you.
I am the bread of life, and whosoever eats thereof shall never hunger again.
I am he whose kingdom is not of this world, and my reward is with me for my faithful and chosen.
I am he who walks amongst the seven lampstands and commands the seven angels of the Church.
I am the holy one of God.
I am your intercessor.
I am he who tries the hearts of man.
I am always ready to cleanse your sins in my atoning blood.
I am the righteous judge.
I am the very Christ foretold from the beginning.
I am the son of God come in the flesh.

I am he who gave my sinless blood for the sinners, that they may inherit eternal life.
I am the son of God come in the flesh.
I am the good shepherd.
I am he who came to my own and was rejected by my own.
I am the very Christ, chosen by my Father from the foundations of the world.
I am that I am.
My children, I tell you truly that I have outstretched my hand to a dying world for many Jubilees now, and my hand shall not always be outstretched in mercy and grace, though mercy and grace are ever with me. I have called many and many have refused. However, the ones I have called and chosen and sanctified and washed and cleansed and healed, those very ones will stand before my judgment seat and carry away great reward for their faithfulness.
Though I have many works for you yet to accomplish and though you have done much for me and my name, I desire your full heart over your works. I desire that you turn to me and depart from your sins. Come clean to me as your Lord is at the ready with my healing hand outstretched that I may make you clean as the fresh snow. Though my hands were pierced, my atoning blood poured from them and from my body to the last drop. I gave my all so that you may live before our Father for all eternity.
Verily, I didn’t atone for one sin, verily I didn’t atone for a few sins, verily I didn’t atone for many sins, but I atoned for all sins for all time. If you will but respond to me when I convict your hearts through my mighty spirit. Do you not understand that I have no desire to condemn you? There is one who has that desire and lusts for your demise and accuses you day and night before my Father, though I am your intercessor. He is cast down and defeated, yet why do you elevate the thief to a lofty place in your hearts when I have complete and utter victory over him and his kingdom that is soon to come to naught. Be still and be at peace and come to me with a humble heart. Know ye not that if you would judge yourselves, you would not be judged? Ask me to show you your life, as I will reveal many things to you so you may confess your faults and be made whole.
Fear not my little ones as it is not me that condemns you. Listen to your conscience and do not rationalize away my voice. This world is about to be cast down and as this world is forever changed you will be lifted into the heavens above that I may present you to the Father, that you may realize your inheritance, and receive your rewards of faithfulness. I have longed for the day that we see each other in the heavens that you may finally have your true life revealed to you as you have escaped this temporal life of evil, sin and wickedness. I am he that tries the hearts of man, not that I would condemn you, but that through the refiners fire you may be purified of your old ways and realize my ways of love, light, joy, peace, longsuffering, and gentleness.
Hear my rebuke and accept my chastisement because your Father deals with you as children and what child that a Father loves is not rebuked and chastised in turn. My chastisement yields the peaceable fruits of righteousness, as my chastisement is to purge you fully from your sins if you will but hear my words and follow my voice. Go stand and speak all the words of this life. There are still some that will come to salvation in this last hour and only the name of Jesus Christ, my mighty name where there is salvation, for

in no other name is salvation given. My mighty name stands firm waiting for you to bring them to me that I may present the penitent to the Father as a newborn baby freshly delivered into eternity. I have great love for you and as the Father has given me I will give to my faithful and chosen.
I am the son of God come in the flesh, sinless and pure for all eternity. Likewise, I am he who gave my sinless blood for the sinners that they may inherit eternal life. Aren’t you, my faithful and chosen, amongst the inheritors of eternal glory? Why do you yet stand silent as if you are waiting for the right words. Speak! Open your mouth and speak, as I will guide your speech to minister to the very hurt my called still suffer, and many will still respond. Join me in my work in this final hour before I shake the foundations of the world and rend it in many places and great judgment engulfs the earth. I will restore this earth to you in my coming Kingdom, but first the kingdom of the wicked will be destroyed and taken in judgment to be chained in the abyss, and they know that the white-hot lake where they will spend eternity awaits.
I will utterly destroy their seats of power, I will utterly decimate all their principalities, I will utterly burn them to the ground with a fire that cannot be quenched, as even I, the Faithful Lord have told you before it happens. In my Father’s house are many mansions, and great majesty and splendor awaits you. Therefore, let no one beguile of your reward and stay faithful to me. Keep your focus single-minded on me the everlasting Lord, even the Lord of glory. I am the good shepherd, I am the very Christ chosen by my Father from the foundations of the World. I am he that came to my own and was rejected by my own, though through great testing Jacob shall be saved by my mighty hand. The consummation of all things is at hand, and the end of the prince of this world is nigh. Though he shall be loosed for a little season his eternal judgment follows, whereof he can never be delivered and there will be no remedy. Return to me, talk with me, minister for me as my Father has given me all things and my reward for you is treasured up in the heavens for my faithful and chosen and is as sure as my Father’s seal that I have sealed you with. There is, but a few minutes left of the age of grace and my judgment will fall suddenly as the wrath of the Lamb comes on the earth. Prepare your hearts and prepare yourselves for the time is at hand.

Take Up A Lamentation
MARCH 13, 2024
The words the Lord has given me, I openly declare: Hear the Word of the Lord!
Take up a lamentation; truly, take up a lamentation for those who yet hold to this fallen world. For they have said in their hearts, “What can come upon me? As it has been of old, it shall continue yet indefinitely; and I and mine will continue to live deliciously, and we shall heap to ourselves this world’s good and treasure up currency, which shall surely save us in time of need.” You have said in your hearts, “We are wise, and we are prosperous; calamity shall not come on us, as it never comes to us, because our God will not let our nation fall; for we are wise and mighty.” Except you are not wise, but wise in your own conceits; and I have given your enemies victory over you.
Oh, man, who will save you from your hour of judgment that is approaching the entire world? Will your leaders save you? Verily, I say not, as the son of perdition comes your way and already openly walks among you, deceiving many with good words and fair speeches. Will your money save you? Nay, all of your treasures will be declared worthless instantly, and there will be no recompense of your life’s works which you greedily hoard. Oh, that you had not abandoned the ways of the Lord and had loved your neighbor and helped the needy with your abundance.
But no, you hoard the very abundance God has given you to satisfy your soul. Verily, I have given many of you more than enough for yourselves and to bless your neighbor; but nay, you have said, I shall keep this great abundance to myself because God has surely blessed me on account of my own goodness and strength. Behold, I tell you a thing before it happens, so in your hour of calamity you will then remember my voice and the words of my mouth that I have inspired in my prophets. For I send them not to speak of their own, but I send them as a warning for you, that you may yet save your soul by turning to me, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is able to save you to the uttermost. But you have said in your heart, Salvation? I need not saving, as I am wonderful the way I was born. Yet your sins are a stench in my Father’s nostrils, and the land has become rotten on account of your iniquities. Know you not that you were born dead in trespasses and sins, corrupting your very nature?
Though I would give you a new, clean nature, you account my sacrifice worthless and cleave to your rotten flesh.
Take up a lamentation for the people of your once great nation who reject my voice. For great sorrow and travail shall come suddenly on you. There will be a mighty shaking, and my mighty host of heaven will rain great destruction on the great harlot, and she shall never rise again, though a remnant shall be saved. Even in your calamity and destruction that surely approaches will I send my prophets to you. You shall know them by their fruit, words, and healings; many healings and miracles will I do by their hands. Yet, even still many shall perish and die in their sins, yet the meek shall inherit the earth; for my inheritance is with me, ready to distribute to the faithful. How long can I outstretch my hand to a gainsaying people who stand against me and my ways and in their deception declare themselves righteous before God in their own dirty garments?

Repent! Weep and howl over your sins, and cry to me that I may yet save you. Many of your churches have been infiltrated by ravenous wolves who preach to you words that will lead you to your end, and still you will not turn from them and turn to me with open face and heart, as I would save you from your distresses and keep your children safe from the armies of the evil one, who openly walk your streets and are already stealing from you greatly. Their lusts will not be satisfied until they have taken everything from you and mutilated many. But those who call on my name shall be saved if they endure to the end.
Why do you harden your hearts against the Lord of Hosts? Why do you yet lie to your own hearts, saying, “There is no calamity; as it was yesterday, it will be today, and tomorrow brings the same?” You scoffers will reap the reward of your faithless ways, and those who reject me will be brought to utter ruin and great distress. Hear my words, oh, adulterous and evil generation. Hear my words and lean your ear into them to hear every letter I will speak. Great shaking will rend your nation that you esteem so mightily, and from great shaking shall come great destruction. I will lay waste your once great cities and I will even bring the water to cover your sinful coasts; for you love not the Lord but are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.
I have no pleasure in your judgment, as my grace and mercy has abounded to you for a long period now. Many of those who have defiled Noah’s covenant will themselves be covered in the waters for desecrating the holy bow of many colors that my Father gave as a pledge. Fire will rain down on you by the hand of your enemies, and many shall perish in the flames and ensuing toxicity. Your land shall be rent, and great calamity will be your supper, for you have rejected the Lord of Lords and King of Kings.
The evil one has imported his Red Army already in your cities, towns, and villages. They walk among you, plotting your destruction; and they wait on their orders and the departure of my restrainer, whom I will loosen shortly. They will mop up and destroy and subjugate what remains. Not only that, but they will claim it as their own, and they will carry many of you off into their camps which they have already prepared. Many will lose their heads for my name’s sake, and I will reward them richly when they stay faithful to the end. There will be no light; there will be fallen bridges and overturned roads. Who will supply you food and water when your nation lies waste never to rise again? But I will still yet save a remnant, and a remnant will I yet save, for I have declared it!
Fear not, my people and my faithful ones. I will snatch you from the midst in the twinkling of an eye into my Father’s house, where I have prepared a place and a table for you that we may sup together, my children. I long for your presence, and soon you will see my face with your own eyes, and you will have the reward of your faith in me because you have faith in your heart when you have not even seen with your own eyes my glory, nor the glory of my Father, who is greater than I. And I have called you and chosen you as my own, and never will you depart from me, as you will evermore be with your Lord and redeemer. Know that I will reward you richly and shower you with blessings that you simply cannot comprehend at this time. Stay faithful yet till the end, for a short time and these things shall come to pass; verily, the hour is late, and the night has already fallen on the earth.

I am the King of King and Lord of Lords, and a name has been given me above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ should all heaven and earth bow the knee.
I am the Prince of Peace, and outside of me there is no peace.
I am he who has given you rest, that you may rest in me and find shelter in my grace.
I am he who walks among the seven candlesticks, who commands my Father’s angels, and all things in heaven and earth are in my hands, as my Father gave them to me in my victory over the evil one until my enemies be made my footstool.
I am your Lord and your redeemer, and I am the good shepherd that has been crowned with all glory, and I hold life eternal in my hands for those who will but humble themselves and ask.
Declare me Lord! Fear not, my little children, as it is the last times and a great multitude shall be saved out of the coming tribulation. Whosoever calls on the name of Jesus Christ shall be saved, and I will heal them and reward them for their faithfulness. Truly, I walk among you, and what great thing has the Lord planned that he has not told his prophets before they come to pass? I tell you plainly, hearken to my voice, as very little time remains before the sound of the last trump. Even the angels stand ready in the heavens above, waiting on the trumpet blast! Your full redemption is at your door, so fear not and cleave to me, for your life is hid in me and is about to be revealed.

The Faithful Shepherd Says
MARCH 12, 2024
The faithful shepherd says to the faithful: Verily, verily I say to you, depart from iniquity and sin not. For my reward is with me to give every man according to his works. I have called you in the Love of my Father that you may have life and have it eternally. I have called you to walk in my Kingdom, to serve me and to dwell on the earth in righteousness, I have given you my grace that you may grow into me, your Lord Jesus Christ. Faint not at my chastisements, for as many as I love I rebuke that my saving grace may take root in the depth of your being so you may do mighty works, works of blessings, works of healing, and that you bear much fruit in me my people.
For my Father is a loving God and my Father’s love cannot be conquered. In me, the righteous Lord, resides all fullness that the Father has given me. He has given all things into my hands and as Pharaoh elevated Joseph and gave into his hands all of Egypt, so my Father has elevated me and given all things in heaven and in earth into my hands. He has given me a name above all names, that at the name of Jesus should every knee bow, both on heaven and earth and every tongue shall confess my Lordship both in heaven and earth.
I have given you eternal life and I have made a path for you to escape the wilderness and to escape that approaching great day of wrath, so faint not! Do not grow weary in well doing, yet stand before me, and I will continue to draw you into my presence. You are seated in the heavenlies and will take part in my throne as I take part in my Father’s throne. I have many crowns and many blessings that are stored up for you, my faithful people. Stand before me and be perfect in me. Depart from your sins and allow the times of refreshing to blow the chaff from your life. In me is eternal life and in me is the new creation, the new man, even Christ in you the hope of Glory! Depart from evil and depart from sin. Continue to declare me among the heathen, as there are still people to save in this final hour. Continue to declare my name, for there is no other name under heaven where men may be saved. Take comfort in the rest that I have given you and lay your burdens at my feet, for my burden is easy, and my yoke is light.
For the faithful (those who have overcome sin and adversity by my atoning blood) to the faithful, I say: I have great reward treasured up for you in my Father’s house. Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and neither has it entered into the hearts of men the things that are prepared for them. I will reward you richly with many crowns so stand for me and be faithful to my voice and my words for in those words you will find life, am I not the Word made flesh who has dwelt among you?
I am the righteous judge
I am the good shepherd who shepherds the flock
I am your healing and I will heal you to the uttermost
I was born of a woman and made flesh, though no sin is in me.
I was crucified for your sins and truly, no man took my life, but I willingly laid it down for the love I have for my Father’s sons and daughters.

I was raised to life the third day, for it was impossible that death should hold me. My Father broke the bonds of death with the power of my resurrection
I am the first fruits of the dead.
Soon you will meet me in the air and the very pains of death will release those who have fallen asleep and then you which are alive and remain shall be caught up together and forevermore will you be with me. I am the Son of God and in my hand is my reward for my faithful. Stand strong, my children, and faint not. Be strong in the Lord and the power of my might, for only my Father is greater than I. I have heard your petitions, and I have received you as my own.
Be patient and continue to labor for me. For soon you will be home with me, and forevermore we will be about our Father’s business. Be strong and be of good cheer. I know many of you see the tribulation and calamity approaching and many of you have seen the armies of the wicked one crossing your borders. Fear them not! Fear them not, even though they would destroy you if only they could, but they are not here for my faithful, as the great escape and the great gathering will yet save my faithful ones from the hour of trying and temptation that is about to come on the entire world. Rest in my Love, knowing that I will never leave you or forsake you, just as my Father never left me or forsook me in my hour of sacrifice. For your salvation is secure in me, therefore push into me as I will strengthen you yet even more than I have. Great is the Mystery of godliness!

Great Calamity Approaches
MARCH 11, 2024
The Word of the Lord came to me; please hear.
Hear my voice, saith the Lord of Hosts! My people, return to me, as great calamity is about to come upon your nation. Great calamity is at your door, and great calamity shall come upon your shores. Return to me and fear me, says the Lord of Hosts. God has passed judgment on America on two fronts. There will be judgment from within and there will be judgment from without. From within will be great shaking, great shaking, and America will fall mightily by great shaking. From without, his armies have come to steal and to kill and to destroy all that is in their paths. No mercy is in their hearts. They have one mind. And they shall take your abundance from you; they shall take your goods from you; they will seize your posterity; and great famine will come on your land. He that is not killed by war shall be killed by disaster; he that is not killed by disaster shall be killed by the wild beasts; he that is not killed by the beasts shall starve. Yet even in your calamity, whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
And I will save my people, even so by great tribulation and by the refiner’s fire. Come to me, my people, while there is still time. Come to me, the Lord Jesus Christ, as I am the righteous Lord. I am the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. I am the good Shepherd, and none is able to pluck my sheep from my hand. Come to me! Come to me while there is yet time, and confess your sins; confess my mighty name as Lord, for there is salvation in no other name. For I, Jesus Christ, am set for your salvation that I have purchased in my own blood. Come to me, yes, come to me in my love that I have for you. Do not resist me, but come to me, that I might yet save you and give you eternal life so that I may bless your posterity. Come to me, my people, and harden not your hearts, as the fathers did in the wilderness. For the Lord your God has pronounced great judgment against your nation, for her sins are many and terrible.
Yes, I have paid for those sins and all the sins of mankind, but my offer and my arms shall not always be outstretched. In the day of calamity, salvation will be obtained through great distress and great tribulation that I will bring on the world to test the hearts of men, and he that endures to the end shall be saved. Follow not the man of sin. Take not his mark and take not his medicine, for a serpent’s bite is therein, and you shall not be healed from the poison of it. Whoever shall take the mark of the beast will have their portion in the lake of fire with the beast and the false prophet. Is it not written in my Holy Word? Have you not read? Have you not heard? Return to my love and come to me, my children, for I call you in this last hour, for great calamity is at your door.
Hear me, says the Lord of Hosts:
For I am he, the Son of Man who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, who died for your sins and was raised the third day. I was raised and I was glorified.

I am the good shepherd, and none is able to pluck my sheep from my hand.
All that the Father has given to me, I shall present to him, and I desire to present you to the Father without fault, blemish, or blame, clothed in white linen dipped in my blood. The only way any man can stand before me is to accept my sacrifice for your sins. Tarry not with the sinners! Tarry not; tarry not! Come out from among them and separate yourselves from their sins. Confess your own sins to me and confess the sins of your fathers to me, for they pass on to you. Live the life I have given you, and walk the path I have laid for you, as I have called you by name. Turn not to the left and turn not to the right, but give attention and singleness of mind to my words. Yet, many shall refuse my invitation, and many shall perish. Have faith in me, as the love of God shall save all who call on the name of the Lord. Have faith in me, and rivers of living waters shall flow from your belly as your sins are washed clean and your spirit is made whole.

Wayward Shepherds
MARCH 10, 2024
The Great Lord, Jesus Christ, says to the wayward shepherds:
You claim to speak in the name of the Lord, me, Jesus Christ; yet you only know my name and do not live my ways nor speak for me. You build broken cisterns that hold no water for my people, and they thirst. Furthermore, you have greedily served your own belly as you rejoice in the lusts of your hearts, and you give all satisfaction and reverence to your flesh. In your hearts you are deceived as you think you fully follow me and represent me to my people, and yet you speak shallow lies, lies that should be cast into the great deep, faithless words not given by me, words of darkness and self- empowerment when you are quite powerless, powerless to lead and powerless to shepherd. Buy eye salve of me and anoint your eyes. Open your ears and be attentive to my word.
Great calamity and destruction is upon the great harlot, and her times have been appointed and her days numbered. Her judgment will come suddenly and without remedy. Yet you have said in your heart, I am God’s representative. I am the just shepherd. I am the glory of God, and by the works of my hands I am the great example of God’s love. You fool! How can you shepherd my people when you don’t even know me, Jesus Christ, the true and righteous Shepherd? Depart from me, as I know you not! You have become a hireling, craving the adoration of men. You have forgotten your first love. Repent and return to me. Stand for me. Shepherd my people in sackcloth and ashes of repentance. You serve your own belly and would sell my Word for your greedy base gain as you lecture my people in sin.
Verily, judgment is upon your nation, and though I would set you apart for a people of my own, you run from my voice and reject my ways, and yet in your deception you declare yourselves holy and an example to the flock. Focus your attention and ears on my voice. Repent and come to me, that I may yet save you and the people who follow you; I would save you from calamity and distress! Those who take salvation as a license to sin will bear their judgment, and your works shall be burned. They who live such will reap outer darkness. You say you are rich, but you are in poverty. You say you are powerful, commanding the very power of God by your words, but your good words and fair speeches are quite powerless. Have I not called you? Have I not given you purpose? Yet you count me absent from my own Church, yet you make yourselves absent from my Lordship. What a man soweth, that shall he reap. Judgment will come suddenly on your nation, and you will either stand with me so that I may rescue you, or you will stand with the judged and partake of her sins and coming plagues of judgment. Sin has consequence even to those who carry the seal of the living God. Verily, the time is upon you when judgment will begin at the house of God. Wash yourselves from your sins in my atoning blood! Repent publicly of your ways. Turn to me because time is almost out. Any man who reckons himself something when he is nothing is deceived and caught in a web of iniquity that has blinded their eyes and closed their ears. Repent and turn to me with your whole heart before it is too late.

I am the son of God who was made after the flesh yet took only part as I remained sinless. I was crucified under Pontius Pilate and died as your sinless Passover. No man took my life, but I gave it freely. I was raised the third day and ascended into the heavens. I am the Son of God who came in the flesh. I am the righteous Shepherd who has lost none given to me. Hear my words and doubt them not. Do not set my words aside as if that is a light thing. As many as I love, I chasten. As many as I love, I rebuke. If the Father deals with you as sons, then blessed you are, because a father chastens his children so that they may stand firm and upright and may receive great reward. Rewards of faithfulness and many crowns shall be placed on their heads for obedience. Turn to me with your whole heart and hear my words. I see your works, yet I desire your full heart over your works. Warn my people of the coming storm, that they may make themselves ready and pure for my impending great escape, when I will gather my Body to me and hide them in my Father’s house from the day of trouble. Depart from sin and return to me, Jesus Christ, my people, as I have called you and desire to make your election sure.
I am the merciful Lord, and I have been given a name above every name. I am the preeminent one, slain from before the foundations of the world. I am the righteous judge, your Lord and redeemer, Christ Jesus!

Why Do You Reject Your Creator?
MARCH 9, 2024
The Lord gave me these words. They are not of me, and I am giving them nothing added and nothing removed to the best of my ability.
Why do you yet reject your creator and his ways? Has he not offered you eternal life? Has he not given you the bread of life, freely for all who ask? Has he not offered you freedom from this fallen creation in me, the great and faithful Lord Jesus Christ? I am the way, the truth, and the life. I am King of King and Lord of Lords, and I gave my life on the cross for you, that you may indeed walk in my kingdom if you will but accept the gift of eternal life. Have I not called you by name? Why do you yet count yourselves unworthy of eternal life, when my atoning blood will make you worthy if you but yet call on my name and make me Lord? I am the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Christ: Jesus the Nazarene, the faithful Lord, even the great Lord! There is none greater but God, who has given me all things.
Behold! A day of calamity is on you, a day of judgment and distress. America’s sins are as the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, and if he were to not judge the great whore, he would be unjust to the generations he took in judgment. That great whore, who lusts after strange flesh, who has been integral in building the beast system for that son of perdition, verily, who walks among you deceiving my elect even before his time. Great judgment and calamity will fall suddenly. America, you are judged from without and judged from within.
The hand of your enemies is about to be on your neck, and you will be violently overthrown, and the nations shall drink no more of your adulterous fornications wherewith you have enchanted all. Your enemies have been given victory over you, though you blindly trust in your military might that I have taken from you. You are a nation in chains, awaiting your final remembrance before the Lord! There is nothing great about you, but your sins and iniquities are a stench in my Father’s nostrils.
You will be judged from within, as a mighty, violent shaking will decimate you suddenly and without remedy. The great whore will be cast down as a warning to all and will be the start of the darkest hour ever. No more will she unjustly overthrow nations.
No more will she plague the world with her iniquities. No more will her abominations seduce my people. The great whore has defiled my Father’s covenant, that glorious rainbow that he gave to Noah as surety to never flood the world again. Though the world shall never again be flooded, the waves of destruction will fall on many, and an all- consuming fire approaches.
My people, be ye not partakers of her sins, plagues, judgment, and calamity. I will still yet set a place for you at my table if you will yet turn to me with your whole heart.
Repent! Confess your sins to me, Christ Jesus! Have you not read that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do you desire your reward to be stripped and given to another? Think not that you will enter into my presence in a state of willful disobedience; has not my Father declared, “I am holy, so be ye holy?” Run to me and submit yourselves to my salvation, for I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and the days of pleading with a stiff-necked generation are coming to a close.

How long have I outstretched my saving hand to you, and yet you reject the God of your fathers and my saving grace that is able to save you to the uttermost? Come to me and hide yourself in my bosom; truly, I will hide you from the great day of calamity that is upon you. Do not join those who have rejected my name; Christ has no concord with Belial, yet my people are still bewitched by his false light. Weep and howl and repent of your lukewarm ways. Return to your first love and seek my face while there is still time.
My atoning blood will wash you if you will but come out of your sins. I am the Son of Man, the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. I am he who kept himself pure in the face of all temptation, even tempted by Satan himself and still victorious. I am the only begotten Son of God who has poured out holy spirit on all who have turned to me and all who will yet turn to me. I, Jesus Christ, am all of these things and more, and I chastise those I love so that their calling may be sure and complete.
O man, your sins are many, yet you declare your own holiness! Sins of adultery and fornication. Sins of pharmakeia, witchcraft, and many sorceries. Greedy, unmerciful, lovers of self, lovers of pleasure, and lovers of money. What will become of your faith in riches when your riches become worthless instantly and poverty and great desolation comes on you suddenly? Will you blaspheme in the face of mercy? Will you yet choose your sins? They who stubbornly choose their sins shall perish in them. Think not that God is mocked, as he is about to make a mockery of the mockers; be ye not partakers with them.
The hour is late, and the final minutes are approaching and time is nearly finished in my age of grace, and wrath will overtake the earth as the true Church is taken before your very eyes. I have no pleasure in seeing my creation destroyed on account of transgressions and unrighteousness; but have I not given you a choice to live in my kingdom, and yet many stubbornly refuse? Come out of her! Rebuke and abandon your ways; confess me, Jesus Christ, as Lord, and cease from sin.
Have I not given great peace to my sons and daughters, who have overcome their sins by my very blood? Yet many still reject their witness and testimony and still refuse to believe, choosing instead their arrogance over my humble ways. Your own ways are a snare and will lead you to utter destruction, whereof you can never be healed. Turn to me while there is still but a few minutes left to do so. The hour is late, and all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved!
I invite you to share in the glory of my throne and accept life with me. Turn from your ways and return to me, as I am the eternal Lord and there is salvation in none other but me! I, Jesus Christ, am the Son of God and have come in the flesh, was crucified, was raised the third day, has been made a life-giving spirit and received into the heavens until times are consummated. Truly, the night is far spent and the hour late, and the times of restitution approach.
My people, stand fast in my might and be at peace. Rest in me and yet a little while your glorification will come instantly, and great reward is laid up for you in my Father’s house. The things I have prepared for you have not even entered your heart, truly, not the heart of any man. Peace and safety you will find, and you who have been faithful over a few things I will reward richly. Rest in me and keep your focus on me. Declare a fast among yourselves and renew your vigor in this last hour and declare my righteous ways and declare my approaching judgment, as even yet many shall be saved.
I have showed you great mercy, great long-suffering, great abounding grace, yet you no longer extend these things to others. Will you sacrifice your reward and force me to give it to another? Or will you love God

My Invitation Is Still Open
MARCH 7, 2024
The word of the Lord came upon me, and I present it without adding or taking away anything.
Behold! My invitation is still open! Come all, and come whomever may, for I the Lord Jesus Christ am set for your rock of defense and am a strong tower for you. There is no other name given under heaven whereby men may be saved, except my name, Jesus Christ. I am the chief cornerstone they reject, thinking they are free. Freedom is found nowhere except in me, Christ Jesus. Why do you let the hirelings lead you astray? Why do you let the worthless ones corrupt you from the single-mindedness found in me? Many paths lead to destruction. But I am the way, the truth, and the life, the true way to the Father that brings salvation and freedom: salvation because I offer remission of sins through my redeeming blood, and freedom because the son shall make you truly free indeed.
Why are you weary, my people? Why do you faint? Have I not provided you rest? Have I not overcome all things, making a way for you to follow my victory and share in my sufferings? Only through accepting my sacrifice of myself can you be redeemed from certain destruction. Only through my blood do you have remission of sins, and through my broken body is healing given, and a new body shall I give you on that day even to my faithful and chosen. For so has your Lord provided for you. I made a path where there was no path: a path in the wilderness that culminates with your glorification, if you will but cease from sin.
This world is corrupt, its knowledge is corrupt, its sciences are spurious, and a web of deceit ensnares my people, leading them out of the way I have chosen for them. Do you not understand that I have called you? That I have chosen you? Do you not understand that you must die to self to find life in me, as your true life is hid in me, the faithful Lord? When I shall appear, so too will you appear in glory; therefore, with singleness of heart, follow me. With singleness of mind, come to me in humble faith. It takes only faith as a grain of mustard seed, and the tree will grow greater than them all.
The times of the Gentiles are drawing to a close, yet Jacob will be saved so as even by fire. In an allconsuming fire shall this world be judged. Verily, the prince of this world is judged and is a defeated enemy. Judgment has been pronounced on him, his kingdom, his followers, and the world he tried to take from my Father. Truly, he desires to rob you of your inheritance, as I have laid a path for you to share in the glory of my throne as I share in the glory of my Father’s throne. I went to prepare a place for you. Do you not understand there are many mansions in my Father’s house? Is anything too hard for me? Have my promises failed you? Or have you been led astray from the single-hearted purpose that I have given you? Why do you yet choose your own ways?
Repent, oh, my children! Confess your sins to me and even the sins of your fathers, as I will hear you in the time appointed. I will glorify you; I will give you newness of life in me. Come to me and receive garments of fine linen! Come to me and receive a new name that I will give you on a stone I have made for you. Let no man beguile you of your reward. Great destruction and calamity is at your door. The world is about to shift into unrestrained evil. The abyss will be opened, and Satan’s full kingdom will be unleashed. I will shake the heavens, I will shake the sea, great shaking will come over the earth. The son of perdition walks among

you as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, waiting for his satanic kingship to come into full view so that he may be revealed in his time. Follow him not!
Run to me, my children, as great wrath and great destruction shall come upon your nation, and many nations shall soon be shaken to the ground. Oh, that you would turn to me and understand your times. Out of the coming destruction the false one will rise, as he seduces many with a lying tongue and will show many false wonders and lying signs. Even now his armies have walked into your cities and filled your streets. Fear them not. Some of them will achieve salvation. The chaff shall be given to the fires. Great trouble shall come on this world suddenly. Suddenly shall their calamity fall on them, and they shall not escape. It is the last hour. Be ye not partakers of her plagues; come out of her, my people, as the great whore has been judged, and her calamity shall come upon her in one hour. The great merchants who trafficked her sorceries shall fall into great distress, and the smoke of her burning will be for all to see. The world’s merchants will bewail her calamity from afar off.
But I have plans for you, my people. Your life is hid in me. Though I have tested you for a season, I have refined you as gold in a refiner’s fire. Come out of her! Awake to righteousness and sin not. Purify yourselves in my atoning blood. Weep and howl over your transgressions; turn from your sins with your full heart. I am he that tries the hearts of men; you can hide nothing from me. Come to me without deceit. Come to me honestly and openly, and I will sup with you and will set a place at my table for you. Soon the Bride shall be gathered, sooner than you may think.
When my Bride is caught up in the air, the restrainer shall be loosed, and no evil thing shall be withheld from natural man. And they will openly follow the lusts and evils in their hearts; therefore, great judgment shall come upon them, and it shall not be remedied. Turn to me, Jesus Christ! Call upon my name while I may be found! Even during the great day of destruction, my name will bring salvation to those who call. Come to me now and come out from her, as time is almost out. The armies of heaven are readied, waiting for the trumpet.
I am the chief cornerstone they reject, thinking they are free.
I am the way, the truth and the life: the true way to the Father that brings salvation and freedom.
I am he that tries the hearts of men; you can hide nothing from me.

To Whom Will You Turn?
MARCH 5, 2024
The word of the Lord came to me.
The Lord Jesus Christ says: To whom will you turn to escape my wrath? Will you place your faith in evil men sent to deceive the very elect if possible? Will you place your faith in the Babylonian beast system, that great whore? Have you been deceived into thinking you can choose your king by election? Do you not understand that Satan is god of this world and deceives the entire world? Will you place your faith in manmade organizations and the houses of false prophets sent to deceive my very elect? To whom will you turn? Where will you go when nothing can be hidden from my sight?
You are seeing the evil ones prepare to hide themselves in their caves in the earth that they have hewn for themselves to escape me, but they have hewn in vain. My wrath approaches and no man can stand. Call on my name while there is still time. The Father has placed all things in my hands, both on heaven and earth, and I will fulfill his plans. There is nothing and no one that can stop me because my Father has empowered me, and I cannot be stopped. The wrath of the Lamb is at your door, even though I still stand at the door and knock. I am eager to come in and sup with you if you will but answer your door.
My people awake!! Awake!! AWAKE!! Awake to righteousness and sin not. I have heard your prayers, and I have seen your vexation of spirit and distress. Come to me with your whole heart and depart from sin. Depart from the sins of Babylon and her leaders; I tell you plainly depart from her fully, even from her apostate churches. For Babylon’s judgment is at hand, and it will come suddenly, leaving her desolate in one hour. For great are her sins; therefore, great is her judgment.
Your only escape is in the safety of my arms and nobody is able to pluck you from my hands. Do not be lukewarm, as the times of separation are already underway. To the people: where will you turn when I gather my bride from among you? Have you not read? Have you not heard?
I am eager to come in and sup with you if you will but answer your door.

Verse I was inspired to share:
Revelation 18
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee: and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy Merchants were the great men of the earth: for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
The voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall no longer be heard because I will gather my bride and hide her in the chambers that I have prepared for the coming time, for in my father’s house are many mansions.

Night Approaches
MARCH 3, 2024
The Word of the Lord came upon me.
Night approaches where no man can work. Prophesies shall cease, tongues shall cease, the gifts to the Church all shall cease when my Bride is snatched away. Then a day of darkness where there will be a famine in the land, a famine of my Word shall there be. Yet even then my angels and prophets of the elect shall still speak for me. A time approaches when the wild beasts shall attack and many shall perish. The day of the Lord has been declared in my Holy Word, and soon it shall be so. Judgment shall break forth suddenly; therefore,, turn from your sins to me, the Lord Jesus Christ, as I have paid for your sins, and you can be white as snow before me in fine linen if you would but give up your own garments. Turn to me in repentance. Humble yourselves before the Lord while there is still daylight, for soon the night shall fall and no man can work. Yet even in those times, anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, as so yet by fire.

Awake!
MARCH 2, 2024
Awake! Awake! Awake! My people, awake, for I the Lord Jesus Christ am calling my people back to me. Do not resist the voice of the Lord when I call you and offer mercy, forgiveness, and peace. There is no peace in this world; though they shall cry peace and safety, do not believe them. There is no peace outside of me, Jesus Christ. Awake! Awaken your brethren! Many will fall to the left and to the right, but it will not come near you if you stay faithful to my voice, the voice of the Lord.
My Bride shall be taken to the inner chambers of the heavens in peace and safety, as they have washed their garments in my blood, the blood of the Lamb! Those who reject me and count the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the perfect Passover, for the sins of mankind as a worthless thing will have no peace. Repent and turn from your sins, as this is the last hour. Do not give yourselves any longer to rationalization and unbelief, as no man can stand before me, Jesus Christ, unless they have washed their garments in the blood of the lamb and purified themselves from sin.
Come out from among her, my people, as the great whore shall be judged suddenly and without remedy. The time of Jacob’s trouble is nearly here, and great judgment and calamity will come to the earth. You have an escape right on your lips if you will confess me, Jesus the Nazarene, as your Lord and believe that God raised me from the dead. Are your sins so precious to you? Are the pleasures of sin important enough to risk eternity in outer darkness? Do you desire the lake of fire? Call on the Lord while I may be found, and call to me when I will hear you, because the hour approaches when no man can work.
Though the Lord will send his prophets during the time of Jacob’s trouble, where will you stand when the Lord raptures his people? Who will minister to you when the Church is taken from the midst? There will be a dearth of scripture in the land, and you will have to find Christ by enduring till your last breath, if you are blessed enough to make it that far. Repent and return to the Lord! Come out from her, my people, and be ye separate. I stand at the door and knock.
The spirit of prophecy has descended on my people over the world, as I promised in holy scripture.
ACTS
2:16 But this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel;
2:17 A nd it shall come to pass in the last days (saith God) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
2:18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy:
2:19 A nd I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath: blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:

How Long? (First Prophecy)
MARCH 2, 2024
The Word of the Lord given by Jesus Christ.
How long, how long, will my people ignore my call? How long will they cleave to their sins? How long will they live in the pleasures of sin? Repent. Repent. Repent! Turn to me with your entire heart. Turn to the Lord your God and to my outstretched arms!
To my Bride: I have given you life, yet your life is hid in me; and when I shall appear, so too shall you appear in the life that I have given you. You have freely received, yet it cost me a great price for your ransom. Will you use my grace as a time to slumber? Or will you use my grace as a time to purify yourselves by virtue of my blood that I shed for you at Calvary? Will you accept my invitation to preach to a dying world and save many of your brethren? Or will you ignore my invitation and instead prefer the pleasures of sin for a closing season?
To all, I say: Return to me with your whole heart; repent with your entire being! Seek my face and accept my forgiveness, as the day of the Lord is at hand, as I have warned my people. I will not be quiet, and I urge you to open your mouths to save those you love and those I will bring to you. Remember your first love, and come to me before the trumpet sounds.

THE BITTER SWEET: GENER AL PROPHECIES AFTER JUNE 19TH).
The Clock Face is Desolate for the Numbers Have Fallen.
JUNE 19, 2024
Are you ready for me, my Bride? (For I am coming) Are you ready? Are you listening? Are you watching? For I am coming for you, so faint not and have great hope and expectation, for the very treasures of Heaven await my faithful and your reward is in my hand! But woe to all who have rejected me in faithless unbelief, even me, Jesus the Nazarene! And so the day of your judgment is upon you, oh, great harlot who sits upon many waters, and your appointed time has come.
Sudden destruction is upon you and your enemies have readied themselves, yet you still live deliciously even though you are a nation in chains before me, Christ Jesus. Your time in the sun happened because for a season your Fathers followed the Son of God and kept my Words. But my Church age has come to a close because you traded the treasures of my mysteries, and even the well- being and love for my people have you merchandised for filthy lucre and acclaim before men.
You sold yourselves in base greed and dishonesty, and you have forsaken me, even Jesus Christ, who died for the sins of the world. But you have refused my word, you have refused my reproof, you have refused my council, you have refused my ambassadors, you have refused my prophets, you have refused my apostles, and you have refused me, Jesus the Nazarene, therefore you have refused Yahweh, and now I will refuse you, oh secret Babylon. And so judgment begins at the House of Yahweh!
For when you could have had peace and safety, you instead chose to blindly follow those who corrupted your nation. Even the Edomites tares who infest the lands, and who have troubled the earth since the evil one spread his abominations across Yahweh’s creation.
So know, that I, even I Christ Jesus, will utterly consume Mystery Babylon with fire and in one hour will your destruction come, for it is written and what Yahweh has declared can no one change. Oh, foolish idolaters of the land of Secret Babylon, if only you understood your scenario. If only you would’ve inclined your ears to my words for I have called, begged, pleaded, exhorted, shouted, shown signs above and signs in the earth and instead of clothing your heart with sackcloth, instead of sitting in the ashes of repentance you instead are entertained as if you were watching magic tricks.
Woe to those who are entertained at the signs of Yahweh in the firmament that announce their judgment, and double woe to you Mystery Babylon, for you have a double portion of judgment that is about to be unleashed, and you will not escape nor recover. Secret Babylon you are a land of instant gratification, and you are most unwise. You have lured the nations in your ways of evil and compromise, and have made them drunk with the filthiness of your fornication. You do not understand my ways, for each among you walks in their own ways as they satanically do whatever they will, do what thou wilt is the whole of their satanic law and so the lawless come to nothing.
You do not understand my ways, for my ways are the ways of Yahweh, and I am the way the truth and the life, for no man comes to the Father except through me and if you have seen me you have seen the Father. But you have shut your minds, you have stopped your ears, you have hardened your hearts, and you have

opened your mouths in blasphemous unbelief, even blaspheming the peace treaty that Yahweh has offered you. For I Jesus Christ, I am your peace!
But no, instead of making me Lord you instead use my holy name, even Jesus Christ, in vain as another word to express the filth in your own hearts. But you cannot profane my name, for Yahweh has given me a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ should every knee bow both in heaven and earth. And you will pay for every idle word, and your times have come. And so now, since you have shut yourselves into your own dens thinking you can hide from Yahweh’s judgment, I will now shut the door of entrance to the heavens for the unfaithful as I snatch my faithful away with me in the heavens for the bridegroom is approaching.
You foolishly think everything has gone back to normal, and the coming war can be watched on TV like the other wars your leaders unjustly waged. As you have been entertained by the death and destruction of other nations, so too will your nation be utterly destroyed, and your death and destruction will provide recompense to those destroyed with your consent.
You foolishly think you can prepare for the wrath to come by living off the land, someplace off the grid, except you will be utterly decimated, captured, killed, hunted, starved, sickened, and many plagues will befall all those who reject me Yeshua HaMashiach, for to reject me is to reject the great eternal God, even Yahweh himself and there will be no remedy. So run to me now!
You foolishly do not understand that the ten horns have colluded with the beast from the earth and the beast from the sea who have not yet risen to full power, and that your once great nation is fully given into their hands for utter destruction. (And with your nations utter destruction the beasts will rise!) For God has placed it in their hearts to fulfill his purposes.
You are utterly surrounded by your enemies vessels, you have allowed millions and millions of the Red Armies, even the army of the beast to infiltrate your lands. You have allowed them to commit acts of sabotage, they have destroyed your supply chains, they have destroyed your food supplies, they have destroyed your economy, they have made camps to cull, torture and execute anyone who does not suit their purposes. Understand that even then anyone who calls on my name, even Jesus Christ, to the end shall be saved. Those who make their choice of refusal final will eternally live with the consequences of faithlessness in the great flames prepared for the devil and his angels, for there is no other choice.
I counsel all who read these words to draw near to me. Quit your senseless debates and quit your senseless bickering amongst yourselves and preach the gospel of salvation as recorded in scripture and preach my word, even the words of my words in these last seconds. Preach them amongst yourselves, and be ever ready to help those in need. Quit judging your brothers and sisters and instead help each other in love to stand in the grace and mercy I have given, for it is sufficient.
Confess and repent from your sins and do so now, you have no time! Make me, Jesus the Nazarene, your Lord, for time is up. Come to me now, for there are no other names given for salvation, except mine, Jesus Christ. Come to me now and depart from iniquity and I will receive you to myself if you but declare me Lord from a faith filled heart knowing that I am raised from the dead to die no more. I have outstretched my open arms to a dying world for many Jubilees now and times of grace and mercy are at a close, though grace and mercy are ever with me for I am a gracious Lord.

And so now, you wait in these final seconds, oh mystery Babylon. For suddenly will it happen. Suddenly will the fire fall, suddenly will the waters cover your skirts that are hiked above your waists, oh great harlot, suddenly violent shaking will come upon you and will tear you asunder, suddenly the command will be given and millions will break across the land to kill every and any living human that does not suit their purposes. They will have no mercy, they have no remorse, they cannot be pleaded with, they have no compassion, but they serve Satan and will fulfill the purposes given for them to fulfill, for they will fulfill the wrath of God on Mystery Babylon and never again will she rise.
Behold! The times are here. Repent while you still are able to draw air, for suddenly will it occur. Hear my words and understand: The restrainer is the only force keeping this evil at bay, and the time you think you have is simply time allowed to stage and move the pieces in place across the world’s board and these times serve Yahweh’s purposes.
Then suddenly I will gather the faithful in my Church to meet me in the clouds and I will snatch my Bride away to her chambers, for in my Father’s house are many mansions and I went to prepare a place for you my Bride and the heavens are readied for you!
And suddenly, when my Father’s precious treasure is safely stored in the storehouse of the heavens (for it will happen in the twinkle of an eye) every yod and every thorn of a yod will come to pass, even every word that I have spoken by my true prophets and apostles, for they are many and the many that are of me speak in unison and speak according to my scriptures. Understand this, those who refuse the plain Words in scripture concerning the gathering of my Church to meet me in the clouds, those same ones who deny will themselves be denied and take their place voluntarily in wrath when such a thing was not necessary, yet how many of you will stubbornly refuse my voice in favor of those who tickle your ears? Yet, so will it be.
If any speak not according to my words, for I Christ Jesus, am the Word made flesh, do not even wish them godspeed for they do not properly discern my Words for my prophets will never contradict scripture for I cannot contradict myself. I am the very words of Yahweh made flesh, and I am Yeshua HaMashiach, the very lamb of God who came to cleanse the sins of mankind.
I am coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and my wrath is hot on the earth, for in righteousness I do judge and make war. Repent oh wicked ones of the earth for your refusal will be eternal. At the end of the seven years of Jacob’s trouble the World will be at rest for there will be a day of rest for a thousand years is but a day in the sight of Yahweh. And the Lion will lie down with the Lamb for my purposes of the Lamb of God will be consummated by the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. Time is up.
I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have these words been sent!

Hear My Words and Gather Yourselves to the Voice of Your Lord!
JUNE 28, 2024
Hear my words and gather yourselves to the voice of your Lord, King, Messiah, and High Priest, even Yeshua HaMashiach. Why do you doubt my words and their order of events, even the rhema details of my words? For I have clearly stated regarding mystery Babylon and her approaching end:
REVELATION
17:13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
17:16 And the ten horns which thou saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
17:17 F or God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
Yet so many of you lack proper scriptural discernment and many of you still have faith in natural man. You have faith in natural man’s abilities, natural man’s power, natural man’s solutions, and natural man’s lies, have you not read that all men are liars my children? Hear me and understand: There is no solution given by natural man that does not lead to the dragon, and the dragon will rule the earth for a short time once the restrainer is removed, and even now is the god of this world, is this not written plainly in scripture?
Why do you still doubt my words, my loved ones and those for whom I long? Believe my words and understand that natural man is powerless, natural man has no abilities of himself to fight Satan, natural man’s solutions end in futility and serve Satan’s purposes, and there is no truth in natural man and your world leaders. For natural man has been corrupted since the beginning at the Garden of Eden by the serpent and goes astray from the womb even born dead in trespasses and sins, and for such a purpose was I, Jesus the Nazarene, manifested that I might undo the works of the devil in those who accept my offer of peace and salvation.
Behold! All world leaders work together behind the scenes, and they all serve Satan. You do not have elected leaders, but you are given a false choice because you never selected those you think you elect by vote, but they are presented to you for your vote that they may gain your consent and your consent is sin because you cannot willingly choose the lesser evil and stand for me at the same time, that is delusion. Repent! Come out from among her and be ye separate! I, even the Lord Jesus Christ in the English tongue and Yeshua HaMashiach in Hebrew, have not provided a political solution and no world leader will arise for I have given none, and those who believe otherwise are sadly deceived. World leaders are all in collusion, and they will not break rank because your leaders all serve Satan either secretly, or openly. Do you still desire good words and fair speeches? Have you not been lied to enough, having lived lives of satanic deception since birth? Why do you yet seek world leaders instead of me, Christ Jesus? For I am your Lord, King, Messiah, and High Priest that Yahweh has provided, and I have purchased the earth and even the lives of the redeemed in my atoning sinless blood. For as your High Priest, I gave myself as your sinless and perfect Passover lamb. And I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I am coming as the Lion of the

Tribe of Judah and will rule from the throne of David on earth and Yahweh’s eternal purposes of salvation and redemption will be consummated in me when the Lion lies down with the lamb in my coming Kingdom and rule that has no end.
Behold! I tell you a thing before it happens. Secret Babylon, even these United States who once served as a beacon of light to the world, is in chains even reserved for fiery judgment. Her judgment and desolation will come suddenly and in one hour will she be burned with fire, in one hour will she be torn asunder, in one hour will her skirts be covered in water even from the east and even from the west. The red armies of the beast have already invaded her borders and are already staging and awaiting orders, and they will kill every man, woman, and child who does not serve their purposes. For the beast and false prophet who are about to be revealed already work in tandem for the destruction of secret Babylon, and they are already in her borders.
They are both former leaders of Secret Babylon. One appears that he is not and puppeteers an old senile stooge that is, and the other appears persecuted by the old stooge, and yet those of the land have proclaimed him their Cyrus and want him as their king, he claims he is the chosen one for the dragon has chosen him to deceive those of the land of promise, and he will build their temple, even when there is no need for such a thing for I Yeshua HaMashiach am the perfect Passover and you are the temple of the living God, even a temple made without men’s hands but by the power of Yahweh for his glory and he will glorify you in me Christ Jesus your Lord!
Behold! These evil beasts and their forming alliance of ten horns already have coordinated Secret Babylons destruction. For they are ready worldwide, and they have prepared and staged worldwide for the final take down of the world as you know it and out of the ashes will rise their new order, out of chaos will rise their satanic order and the mark will be enforced to enter their society and God’s people will live in the wilderness as in the days of Noah and relatively few will survive. For the beast and false prophet will make war with the saints and overcome them. These are they which will come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
Behold! The enemy comes and the order of events follows: The restrainer will restrain until I gather the faithful in my Church to meet me in the clouds at my appearing for my Church, even my Bride. Though many of you deny plain scripture on this event, it will happen, and it will be known worldwide. There is no secret rapture, for those are the words of Zionist false prophets and my appearing will be undeniable worldwide. They will seek to cover your departure with war and a fake alien invasion, but there are no aliens only fallen ones who pretend. When my Bride is taken into the heavens and the restrainer is removed sudden destruction will fall suddenly across the world and all nations that once pretended to be Christian will cease to exist in the manner they currently exist, yet there will be a remaining people that are conquered and culled. Mystery Babylon will fall first and suddenly at the same time as their surprise attack commences, but she will not ever rise ever again, for Yahweh has declared a double portion of judgment on her.

For Mystery Babylon has led the nations in great sin and deception through her witchcraft and sorceries even her so-called ritualistic entertainment and for her abominable sorceries passed for medicines that are in truth deadly poison. And so shall her end come suddenly and without remedy. And a wasteland will remain, though a remnant will be saved, for whosoever calls on the name of the Lord and loves not their lives to the end shall be saved.
So understand the times you live and understand the coming order of events and understand that there is nothing that can change these events, for what Yahweh has declared can no one change!
Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent.
I will appear suddenly, are you ready my Bride?

Why Do You Grow Impatient?
JULY 5, 2024
Come, bow your hearts and ears and hear the Words of your Lord, my Church and even my Bride. Why are you so suddenly removed from your hope in my appearing, as if I’m not coming? As if the declarations of Yahweh can be changed? Has the great eternal God, Yahweh, forgotten his promises? Have I forgotten my words and promises? Truly, truly, I say not! And all who ascribe folly to Yahweh, the great eternal God, and to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, the Great Lord of Lords and King of Kings, should repent immediately. Ask for forgiveness my children and continue to make yourselves ready for I will appear suddenly, and you will stand in awe at how quickly the next major event in Yahweh’s plan of redemption for mankind comes to pass, for it will happen suddenly and unexpectedly for so it has been declared. For it will happen that I will resurrect the dead in Christ first and you which are alive and remain will be taken to meet me in the clouds, and it will happen in the twinkle of an eye.
Why do you grow impatient? Why do some of you pretend that things have returned to the way they were? Clearly there is no returning to the ways of old, for the world that now is will meet strong calamity and forever will be changed, and it will change further during Jacob’s trouble and the earth will be as in the days of Noah. When the restrainer is removed there will be nothing to keep the evil hordes at bay, even the armies of the fallen ones who will attack all that is of me, for Yahweh has given the dragon power to make war with the saints and to overcome them. Many will come to me through the destruction of their flesh, even the flesh that they love and still binds them. For all who call on the name of the Lord will be saved, and the servant is not above his master.
Though I have offered escape from the coming destruction for the faithful, many are not ready but will be saved and serve great purpose in my coming Kingdom, for I will rule from the throne of David and I share in my Father’s throne, and you will share in my throne my faithful. For those who are not ready they will suffer much for my namesake, and they will suffer as I, Jesus the Nazarene, suffered to secure mankind’s salvation and through my crucifixion I have left an example of obedience unto death for all to follow. And through great tribulation will many multitudes be saved and come to great reward in me Christ Jesus, and even serve Yahweh in his temple. Great reward awaits all who call on my name, and those who call on my name until the end will be saved, even those who love not their lives to the end. For this world is perishing and will be destroyed and punished utterly before my Kingdom of righteousness is established on earth.
So faint not my Children, for my promises are yea and amen and I will snatch my bride away into the heavens as promised, and not one person who is ordained for eternal salvation by Yahweh before the foundations of the earth were laid, will be plucked from my eternal hands and your salvation is secure in me, Christ Jesus, only stay faithful and remain in Christ until the end. This has always been a requirement from Yahweh, that a man be found Faithful in his ways. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, do bring the ways of Yahweh and those who learn of me do learn the ways of Yahweh, for I am one in unity and purpose with my Father. Soon you will be one with us, is it not written that you are made part of the eternal Godhead, for so is your inheritance and so is my reward for the faithful sons of God who were found faithful in me. For in me, Christ Jesus, dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you will share in my inheritance for your faithfulness, and you will share in my throne as Kings and Priests and my Kingdom has no end.

So stand fast for me in these final seconds of the age, and understand that time is up. Yes, time is up for Mystery Babylon to repent. My times of grace and mercy are up, though mercy and grace are forever with me. Now comes great judgment on the earth, and the nations and even the land. But judgment will not fall that eliminates all the living, but will fall and accumulate. Judgment upon judgment, seal after seal, trumpet upon trumpet, vial upon vial, woe upon woe, and plague upon plague. And as a result many, many, many people will come to salvation in me, Jesus the Nazarene, for I am the perfect Passover Lamb for all time, and there is no more need of sacrifice. But for you, my faithful Bride, the times of waiting are ended.
There will be no more delay, and no more wait, and you will come to your full reward and inheritance in me. And even though some will suffer loss, eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor entered into the heart of men, the things that Yahweh has prepared for those who love him. And so it is my faithful loves, you have shown your love for me, Christ Jesus, and your love for Yahweh because you obeyed my commandments by faith in this evil day. Even though you have not seen me with your own eyes, nor have you beheld Yahweh’s eternal glory with your own eyes you have remained faithful in me to the end, therefore is there great reward treasured up for you in the heavens, so faint not!
Continue in patience, my Children, for I am approaching. Do not listen to the scoffers who mock you because their scoffing will very soon be turned to great sorrow, and many who scoff will fall into silence as their lives are at an end. For so are the coming judgments. For those who have rejected my outstretched arms and counted my atoning blood an unholy thing and reckoned themselves unworthy of eternal life in my coming Kingdom, even the same will inherit darkness and death they so loved and desired and many will fall willingly to the second death.
For in my Father’s great love, even Yahweh the eternal God for there is none like him, he will not force not one of his creations to follow and love him. All are given free will and all will receive the reward of their choice. For so are the laws of Yahweh. Those who love evil, who love the pleasures of sin and love the evil their sins cause others who suffer unjustly on account of their lusts and froward ways will inherit their own evil ways back into their bosoms and so their punishment shall be and every sin will be recompensed eternally. But for those who accept Yahweh’s peace treaty, even me Jesus the Nazarene, will inherit everlasting life and peace and reward and love and eternal joy in my presence and the presence of Yahweh himself, for soon Yahweh’s dwelling place will be among men for so it is written. And I am approaching to snatch you away to the throne room of Yahweh himself, where you are already seated, and your crowns await you.
Do not believe their lies my children, I am coming for you, only remain steadfast another second or two, for my appearing is at hand and will happen any second now, and I will exceed your expectations. Prepare yourselves and purify yourselves in my atoning blood. Continue your lives of repentance and continue to crucify your fleshly ways, for they are not of me and no evil thing will enter my Kingdom and no evil thing will stand in the presence of Yahweh. I am your eternal sacrifice and I have made you without spot or wrinkle and there is no stain on my faithful because my blood continuously purifies you as you confess your sins in repentance, even though your flesh is utterly corrupt.
Come to me with an open heart and I will lovingly show you your shortcomings so you may confess your sins to me, and in so doing I will cleanse you and will continue to make you whole according as you are a new creation in me, Christ Jesus. And truly, truly all who are sealed with my holy spirit of promise, whether

Judean or Gentile, (whether bond or free) will be fully recreated as one new man in me Christ Jesus and will stand in glorified liberty for eternity! For I am a life giving spirit, for so has my Father made me. And I am that the great I AM has made me forevermore. And now so to you will be made like me in a glorified body, a body fashioned in reward that will embody your accomplishments in your stand for me in this evil day. Not one of your efforts will go unrewarded: For God is not unrighteous, that he should forget your work, and labor of love, which you showed toward his Name, in that you have ministered to the Saints, and yet minister.
Your true selves are hidden in me, even your savior and Messiah. Forevermore will you be with me, and you will be of one mind and heart with me Yeshua HaMashiach and even with Yahweh, for the Great El Shaddai, even the Almighty God will be all in all for his purposes will be fulfilled in you, my called, chosen and faithful. I am coming for you, my Bride, are you ready? Do you have oil in your lamps? Have you washed yourselves fully in my atoning blood? Have you stopped washing one another’s feet?
Watch! Look! Listen! Watch for my appearing and encourage each other because Satan would hide my appearing if such a thing were possible. Look to me, the author and finisher of your faith, for in the twinkling of an eye will you be changed and fashioned like me forevermore. Listen to my Words and be ready for my appearing and above all be obedient out of Love for Yahweh and for me to keep my holy Word in pureness of heart, knowing that your redemption no longer draws near but is here.
I am one in unity and purpose with my Father, and soon you will be one with us
I am the perfect Passover Lamb for all time
I am approaching. Do not listen to the scoffers who mock you
I am coming for you, only remain steadfast another second or two
I am your eternal sacrifice
I am a life giving spirit, for so has my Father made me
I am that the great I AM has made me forevermore
I am coming for you, my Bride, are you ready?

Behold! The Restitution of All Things Is Near!
JULY 09, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach:
The times of restitution are approaching the earth, but first the times and consummation of the great judgment must be fulfilled. And I, Christ Jesus, will judge the earth for the earth is mine and the fullness thereof, and I have purchased the earth in my atoning blood at Calvary. Of an unchangeable truth, I gave every drop of my innocent blood that was shed for the sins of mankind. For those who accept my offer of peace and eternal life there will be peace, and eternal life, and the ways of righteousness will prevail. For those who reject my offer they have chosen the ways of death, judgment, and eternal punishment, for the world passes away and there is no other choice. And so they will bear their judgment and every sin, evil word, evil thought, and evil act will be laid bare so they may give an account. But those who reject my salvation will never be able to stand, and by default choose the lake of fire that is prepared for the devil and his angels and such a thing is not necessary, but each are free to choose. I am he who is coming to judge and make war, and Yahweh’s ways will rule the earth in righteousness in my coming kingdom. For you my Church, and even my precious Bride will be taken to the heavens, and you will receive your inheritance, and you will take your places amongst the orders I have prepared for you, even your place amongst Jacob for you are the Israel of God.
For in me, Christ Jesus, there is neither Judean nor Gentile but a new creation, and that creation will move as one new man. Behold! You will be a new man, and you will be a new creation, have I not given you the down payment of holy spirit? Even the seal of the living God, which cannot be broken? Which of you can undo the birth of your natural children? You cannot because your genetics are passed from generation to generation and children are permanent. And so it is, the seed of Yahweh created within God’s children cannot be corrupted, for it is impossible that you should be plucked from my hands. Have you not read? For you are borne again, not of mortal seed, but of immortal, by the word of God which lives, and lasts forever. My children, are my words too wonderful? Have you allowed false voices to lead you astray from the single-mindedness in Christ? There is nothing that can remove the seed of Yahweh once it is created within, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. So why do you doubt your salvation? Though your flesh will cause you to sin, and I will forgive you and cleanse you as you confess your sins in repentance, there is nothing that can remove God’s children from the family of God. For those who live unrighteously their works will burn, and they will stand naked and ashamed, and for those whose works stand as righteous will receive great reward, but God’s children receive permanent salvation. If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
For those who live apostate lives and for those who pretend to live for Christ in name only will fall away as the true Church departs. For he that sows to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption. And for those who tried to make me Lord from a faithless heart and continued in sin will be left to Jacob’s trouble for the destruction of the flesh and will need to call on the name of the Lord till the end, and so will it be. Those who deceived themselves until their last breaths and did not die in Christ and never had a saving relationship with me will face their judgment. Do you think Yahweh who is the searcher of hearts is foolish? Do you think that me, Christ Jesus, does not try the hearts of men for faith and trust in me? But so it will be,

and I will say to many who call me Lord: Depart from me, you workers of iniquity, I never knew you.
But for you my Church, my called and faithful and chosen: Even every soul who has achieved salvation is also made heir of the promises made by Yahweh to the Fathers. For it is written that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel, and I have grafted them into the natural Olive Tree. And all who are created newly in me will be fully restored to perfection and righteousness and true holiness. Have I not promised you spotless garments, my little ones? And I have appointed your inheritance amongst the tribes, for you are the Israel of God whom I have redeemed from the earth.
Quit thinking in terms of Adamic genealogies, for the blood of Adam is corrupted in sin! As it is written: the first man Adam was made a living soul, and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Have you not read? They are not all Israel, which are of Israel. For the children of promise are the seed of Abraham by faith, and as it is written the Just shall live by faith. And in me, Christ Jesus, are all things consummated for the Lion shall be in perfect union with the Lamb and you are identified fully with me, Christ Jesus your Lord. Behold! But to you that fear my Name, shall the son of righteousness arise! I am the son of Righteousness, even the only begotten son of the most high God, Yahweh, for there is none like him, and I am he who is here to snatch my church from calamity, even my bride away to her home in the heavens, and she shall ever be with me. For so shall it be, I will connect you to your true family for Israel was scattered abroad and in the Israel of God shall they be gathered, never to be scattered again, for you are the Israel of God!
So I will snatch my Church away to the heavens, my faithful ones, and you will forever be with me. For you are espoused to one husband: Yeshua HaMashiach, and by my spirit I have made you a chaste virgin and purified the faithful so they may stand righteous in my atoning sacrifice. When you are taken you will be rewarded for your faithfulness and many crowns will you carry away, though some will suffer loss. You will be rewarded beyond your wildest imaginations, for eye has not seen nor ear heard nor entered into the heart of man the things Yahweh has prepared for them that love him. And the faithful, even my Bride, will forevermore be with me, and they will reign as kings and priests forevermore, for there is no end to my Kingdom.
And so my angel shall ascend to where you will be with me in the heavens and seal 12,000 from each tribe. Have you not read my Words given to John the Revelator? And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. Did you not see the word ascend? The holy angels of heaven descend to the earth, for their home is in the heavens. For a holy angel to ascend, he is ascending into the heavens. It is the fallen angels who ascend to earth out of the abyss, do you not respect the Words of my holy word?
And they will seal 12,000 from each tribe listed: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manassas, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph, Benjamin. And so my 144,000 will have the seal of the living God in their foreheads. And they will stand with me on Mount Sion, and they will sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb wherever he goes. For these were

215

THE

The BITTER SWEET

redeemed from among men, being the first-fruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
The 144,000 are chosen by Yahweh before the foundations of the earth for such a time. They are forged in affliction, and they will possess unique abilities and strengths that I will clothe them in their new garments that I will give, for your garments are tailored specifically for you and will contain your accomplishments and attributes. They will be taken in the gathering of the faithful but are set apart for my purposes, even the purposes of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach. They come during the great tribulation to lead Israel to safety. But first are taken to marry Christ for they are his Bride, the called, chosen, faithful, and true. Even those whom Christ has made pure as a virgin in his atoning blood. And it is you my bride who shall serve Yahweh’s purposes at my command in the times of the greatest troubles.
For you are the first fruits gathered from the fields of harvest, for I am the Lord of harvest, and now it is time to gather you into my barn that you may receive the reward of your labors. For those who have gathered wheat will have plenty and those who have gathered straw shall suffer loss as the chaff burns in the fire, but yet they shall be saved. And so my laborers and people shall come to their inheritance in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, for I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings and I will not be silenced nor will I be stopped.
Is it not written? Thus, saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, wherever they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms anymore at all: Neither shall they defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent! Behold! I am he who is coming in the clouds, so make yourselves ready, my wise virgins.
From Yahweh the Great Eternal God:
I see your fear, oh fallen ones, for now comes your judgment even the great judgment promised of old, and the times of the great judgment declared in times past by me, Yahweh the great eternal God who pronounced your judgment and seven thunders uttered their voices and so the voice of the almighty God shall be heard! And my purposes shall be brought together, even my plans for the ages will be consummated in my son Jesus Christ. For in the first fruits comes the rewards of harvest for the laborers sent forth by Yeshua HaMashiach and my wheat will now be gathered into my barn and the final separation on earth will begin and Jacob’s trouble is here.
Behold! I will part the heavens above and shake the earth beneath, and I will gather the remaining heirs of salvation from the earth, and they will come to salvation, and they will call on the name of the Lord till the end, and they will serve me in my temple and a mighty and great multitude will be saved out of Daniels seventieth week. I, even Yahweh, will rend the earth and remove the mountains from their places and all the world shall know that El Shaddai has risen from on high and the great judgment will now break forth

upon the earth when my Faithful are gathered for transgressions will be ended, even the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel.
In their place will come the rule of righteousness, even the righteous rule of my only begotten son, Yeshua HaMashiach, in whom I am always well pleased. It is he who will smite the nations with a rod of iron and a rule of righteousness will it be, where the Lion shall lie down with the lamb. And so shall it be the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek and the Lord of Lords and King of Kings will fully unite in eternal consummation and forever shall his reign be, even Yeshua HaMashiach for the same is also Jesus Christ!
Prepare yourselves those who dwell on the earth in unrighteousness for I send my son to exact my judgment and to smash to pieces all rule of the fallen ones, for their times have come and judgment will fall heavy on the earth. For you have treasured up great wrath against the day of wrath and the day of wrath is upon you, oh worthless ones, for you have defiled yourselves in utter depravity, and you have no peace for your filthy abominable ways. But before you go to your eternal inheritance where you will be engulfed in the hottest flames of blue, you will first serve my purposes, for even my enemies obey my voice.
And so judgment will begin at the house of God and I will send my son even Christ Jesus the resurrected Messiah of Israel and the savior of the world, and he will perform all that I have ordained and promised to the Fathers and to the children and all shall be yea and amen as fulfillment of the promises comes to pass.
For the heavens have been made ready for my Children, even all whom I have ordained for my purposes before creation began. For I knew each and every one of you in eternities past, and I set you as a mystery hidden in my heart that I only revealed at the proper time in my eternal plan of salvation. There is nothing that can happen that I am not aware before it happens, and it Is I, The Almighty God, who calls things that are not as though they already are. Oh, you fallen ones, you will utterly burn in your approaching judgment, and you were foolish enough to think you could take Yahweh by craft, but I AM HE who takes the proud in judgment, for they are wise in their own conceits. For I only showed you the worthless mysteries, for I knew you would betray all that is of me. How foolish you are oh fallen ones and you are not wise. All you have accomplished is your own torment and continual destruction in the hottest flames, and you will swim in fiery brimstone, for so the great lake burns forever, and I will set the seal, and you will be utterly forgotten, and you will not come to mind.
But this fate is not for you my chosen, my faithful, even all who are called by my name. Yours is a future of eternal joy, eternal happiness, eternal bliss and there will be no end of days and there will never be a bad day for those who enter into paradise. Behold! I will restore all things and even make them better than my original perfection before corruption fell, for I will create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness and nothing will enter that is evil nor defiled. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and makes a lie, and they all will have their part in that burning lake where their worm dies not.
So there is nothing to fear in your future my called, chosen, and faithful, and you will ever rule with Yeshua HaMashiach and there is no end to his kingdom or rule. And I the great eternal God, even Yahweh himself will make my abode amongst men and there will be peace and harmonious perfection over all of my creation and I will wipe all tears away from their eyes and never again will anyone rise who will trouble you in the least, for I, Yahweh, even the great eternal God, swear these things by my own name for I can swear

The Rising of the Unholy Three!
JULY 13, 2024
And so time is at an end and my appearing is approaching! I will now tell you the order of events that are soon to come to pass, so hearken yourselves to hear the voice of your Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach, even the words of the Lord of Lords, King of Kings, Messiah, and high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Perhaps your national arrogance will blind your hearts to me, oh Mystery Babylon: even these United States. For you think you sit as a queen and no calamity will fall on you, and you say to yourselves, I am no widow! Yet your desolation will come within one hour and never again will you rise nor will your leadership ever plague Yahweh’s earth again, for a double portion of judgment has been declared by Yahweh, and what Yahweh declares can no one change.
Imagine, if you will, a world without Christianity and Christian nations. There will be no more Churches and Christianity will be illegal worldwide and the Church age has come to a close even my age of grace declared by my apostles and prophets during the first century, and they planted the seeds where you are able to find shelter in these times of trouble, even my holy Word and mysteries of God! It is important to interpret these events with the exact language used by John the Revelator, for he stated: And I stood upon the sand of the sea: and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads, and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads, the name of blasphemy. And again: And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And again: the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And so will be the rising of the unholy three, the beast from the sea, the beast from the earth who is also the false prophet and false Moshiach, and the dragon who gives them great authority.
There is no central anti-Christ, though spirits of anti-Christ have gone out in the world and deceive many, but two beasts and the dragon. One to rule the sea, or the Gentile nations, and one to rule the holy lands, who is from the tribe of Dan and is a beastly temple builder. The beast from the sea will rule the nations, or goyim via the Noahide laws, and they are already in place, and they are both anti-Christ in nature. Antichrist is in opposition to me, Christ Jesus and in place of Christ Jesus as well. For behold! The mystery of iniquity is well advanced and Satan waits on your departure, my Church, even my Bride. He will rule from an ecumenical, syncretized religion and will claim to be their Mahdi. Ecumenism will unite them, under the falsehood that all roads lead to the same god. Except, me Jesus Christ the true Messiah will not be allowed, and I have no part in them and their destruction lingers not. So their ecumenism will lead to their beastly society where the mark will be forced on the nations to participate in their society. Take not the mark, for whoso does will share in the lake of fire with the beast and false prophet. And all who take the mark will be forever genetically altered. Have you not read? And where you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. Those who take the mark will be a slave to the rising system and will be slave to the hive mind which will occur from the mingling of flesh with technology.
The sea represents Gentile nations. The false Noahide laws already states that Christianity is idolatrous and prescribes beheading as punishment. These laws are in place and will be ruthlessly enforced. And those who call on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved, for it is written: And God shall wipe away all

tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne, said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, write: for these words are true and faithful. And so will your future be, my tribulation saints, for I will yet save Jacob and all who call on my mighty name in whatever language they call.
The Beast from the earth, who is also the false prophet will rule Israel, and he will rule the World from the promised land, but not the people of God, not the Israel of God for you are the Israel of God, even the children of the most high who are sealed with the seal of the most high God, and Yahweh’s seal cannot be broken. And a great multitude will come out of Jacob’s Trouble and will take their rightful places amongst the Israel of God, for both Judean and Gentile will be saved and will be one new man for I will recreate them in me at the resurrection of the just.
My children, the Synagogue of Satan has prepared their rule and they have no remorse, you are two legged animals to them, for they follow the blasphemous Babylonian Talmud, a book that is from Satan and not Yahweh, for Israel turned from Yahweh long ago when they rejected me, Yeshua the Nazarene, and I will yet save my people. These are the same type of tares where I told their Fathers when I told them plainly: You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do: he has been a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, then he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. Understand my Children that Dan is a lion’s whelp and Dan has no representation in the 144,000. These tares eagerly await their temple builder, and they already recognize him as their king. The beast from the earth is the one who brings the mark of the beast. Even operation war seed, that has now been tried and perfected for distribution and enforcement by death for those who refuse. The earth represents the land of promise.
My Children, quit believing the lies of those who do not speak for me, for I did not send them. My true prophets speak in unison, and they are many, and they do not contradict each other, nor scripture, for I am the Word made flesh. These two evil beasts do not receive their power from some corrupt church father, but the Dragon himself, for the Dragon is the devil. Understand that Christianity will have no play at all because all false churches are judged and destroyed for judgment begins at the house of God, and my true Church, even my called Faithful and chosen will be taken into the heavens to receive their rewards and begin their eternity. And it is given to the dragon to rule, and aliens will appear, but they are no aliens but fallen angels of which the Dragon is their head. Many of these have been kept in chains since the days of Noah but are now released for their final judgment which slumbers not.
The beast from the sea, even he whose name is translated into English from Hebrew: Lightning fall from heaven: study to learn. For he does not desire women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. The dragon beast from the sea, and beast from the earth will rise from the ashes as heroes for destroying Secret Babylon, the great harlot, and they all work in collusion. They hate America and anything associated with the name of Jesus Christ, but they will bow the knee just the same in their judgment, from which they will never recover. So, scripture cannot be understood in the current configuration of nations and the earth itself. For Yahweh is preparing to bring great shaking on the earth in judgment and borders will be redrawn. This is their final war to destroy the old order, and bring in Satan’s order who will rule mankind via the beast from the sea and beast from the earth who is also the false prophet. Ten horns, who

are ten kings who will receive power to rule for one hour, for so it is given, will give their power and consent to this beastly trio.
Behold! I will give you a basic order of events so you will know the times you live. Some of these events happen in succession, and some happen simultaneously, and they are as follows!
• Mystery Babylon is destroyed as world war breaks across the earth, and even now they are staging their militaries and are planning a very well coordinated attack on Mystery Babylon. Do not believe your leaders, nor the media, for they are a pulpit of liars who are part of the attack.
• The beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth, and the dragon will rise from the ashes of war.
• These two evil beasts will stand in opposition to the 2 witnesses who will prophesy for 42 months, at which time they will be killed and will ascend into the heavens in three and a half days and so their resurrection will be.
• A s the temple is built, war on the saints continues 42 months and the mark of the beast is established, administered and enforced under pain of death. Then the turning point, when the abomination of desolation is carried out and the beast from the earth will seek to kill all who would come to me, even Yeshua HaMashiach during this time.
• The beast from the earth declares himself God and turns against the people to kill them, for he betrays the people in similar fashion as Antiochus Epiphanes.
• A nd I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his Father’s Name written in their foreheads. (Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.)
• M y 144,000 will shelter my people and take them to places of safety to weather the storm as the land is cleansed from all unrighteousness, even the evil tares. For had I not shortened the days no flesh would survive, and so I will shelter many in the wilderness. This will happen in part so that a remnant of mankind is saved.
• T he 144,000 come to earth clothed in garments that I will specifically tailor for them, and they are unbreakable and will be mighty and powerful and no element of the enemy will gain ascendancy, and so the purposes of Yahweh will be fulfilled.
I Am Yeshua HaMashiach and I have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent
Look to the skies my faithful Church for I am approaching and will take you into my Father’s house where I have prepared a place for you and you rule with me as Kings and Priests, of which my Kingdom knows no end, so comfort yourselves with these Words.

The Choice is Yours!
JULY 15, 2024
Hearken to the words of your savior, Lord and King my Children and incline your ears to the Words of your Lord, even Jesus Christ the righteous, for I am the son of righteousness and I do rise in my glory, and you have grown as calves of the stall in relative peace and safety and I have raised you for a heavenly purpose that is about to be fully revealed in you, my faithful and chosen. Behold! I am he who tries the hearts of men so that you may know for a certainty whether you are truly in the faith, or if you are deceived and carried away by your sins and the current strong delusion that has captivated the World.
For I am he whom Yahweh has shared his throne, even Christ Jesus the risen and empowered Lord, and I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings and behold the Lion of the Tribe of Judah is coming in the clouds to receive my faithful to me so that they may be taken into the heavens for the marriage of the Lamb, for my Bride has made herself ready. And her lamps are full, and she has trimmed her wicks, and she awaits my appearing as a wise virgin, even those whom I have purified fully and are without fault before the throne of God. Even those whom have not been taken in craft by Barabbas, for Barabbas brings violent insurrection, war and calamity, for he is currently one head amongst several heads who work in collusion, but he will rise a false Moshiach, and he is chosen of the people of the land to rule the synagogue of Satan. For he is heir of whom their fathers chose, and they are making themselves ready to receive him as their King.
But you, oh Church of Laodicea, now comes your times of desolation and judgment. For you have chosen to yourselves another savior as your King, even he whose coming is heralded by lying signs and wonders and who currently has led you with enchantments and sorceries. I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I have purchased you in my own atoning, sinless blood, and I am he who would make you whole, and recreate you anew in my spirit, for I have been made a life giving spirit for so has Yahweh ordained all preeminence on his Son, even he who is the consummation of the lamb of God with the Lion of the Tribe of Judah! And in righteousness I will judge and make war for the lamb of God and the Lion of the Tribe of Judah are consummated in me, Christ Jesus, even Yeshua HaMashiach for so I am!
I will yet complete your salvation, oh Church of Laodicea, but you are not ready to enter into my Kingdom at this time because you have strayed from your single-minded purpose in Christ! I will show you your error, and you absolutely have an opportunity to repent from all sins, but you do not have any time remaining to argue with the voice of your Lord, for so this grievous sin is one of many Satan has used to bind you from coming fully to me in repentance that I may fully cleanse you in my atoning blood from your sins.
Behold! The times of the Gentiles are at an end and the wild olive tree that was grafted in amongst them, and with them partakes of the root and fatness of the Olive tree, will now be cut off. For you have ignored the Words of Christ Jesus, for I told you plainly not to boast against the branches that fell in unbelief: but if you boast, you bear not the root, but the root you. I am the Root of Jesse, and I am he who stands as a beacon of hope for all time, even he who brings salvation and the ways of Yahweh to the earth and I will rule my inheritance from the throne of David in righteousness and I have purchased the earth in my sinless blood and I will take what is rightfully mine forcefully from the hands of the squatters, even the fallen ones.

I am he who has given grace and mercy to the earth, for an entire age of grace was given to me by Yahweh for the salvation of the Gentiles. For Yahweh’s purposes in Israel were always that the Gentiles would be blessed and come to salvation through Israel’s obedience. But in the course of time they became prideful, and boastful, and they were cut out of the natural olive tree in unbelief. But you, my Laodicean Church, even you are the epitome of this same type of arrogance, unbelief, and blindness shown by the natural branches who were cut off in unbelief, and now you will be cut off from the natural olive tree. And I will now move to finish my work on the natural olive tree, even Israel my kinsman and people, even all those whom I have chosen to accept me as their Lord that I may recreate them as one new man and that the mystery of God should be finished, even the culmination of my atoning works of salvation.
And you, my Laodicean Church, have left your first love and are in the arms of a deceiver whom you have sworn fidelity. You have chosen for yourselves a new Barabbas even as your King and have rejected Jesus the Nazarene as your Lord and are in the arms of another false savior. Even he who poses as mystery Babylon’s savior, who talks and acts as one of you, but speaks as a dragon. For mystery Babylon lives deliciously and in great material abundance, pleasure and wealth.
And mystery Babylon has made the entire world drunk with the filthiness of the fornication contained in her golden cup, but so are the ways of the fallen ones, who offer the worst filth, and you drink it willingly and with great delight because you are blinded by the golden cup to the utter filth you filthily consume. For even my Laodicean Church no longer gathers around my holy scriptures but at the rallies of Barabbas, in whom you trust. And so you choose a new savior because you love the world and the things of the world and cannot fathom the idea that you would loose your prized delicacies, except I will take all pleasures from you in my approaching wrath, and even now your losses multiply!
For you are blind and delusional in your arrogance that Yahweh would provide another savior than me, Jesus the Nazarene, for I am the promised seed of the woman and Dan is a lion’s whelp of whom no Messiah shall arise. Hear me and hear me well, oh church of Laodicea, for now is either your repentance from your hearts offense or now is the time I will leave you to the refiners fire and all who call on the name of the Lord to the end will be saved and many who confessed my name faithlessly will fall away into oblivion, having wasted their opportunity on a form of godliness that denied the power thereof: My Laodiceans, I am the power thereof and in me Yahweh has placed all preeminence, and you have denied me, your Lord and savior, and I will spew you out of my mouth unless you repent now!
During my age of grace, salvation spread amongst the nations, and nation after nation shared and partook of the root of the natural olive tree. And now, the nations will no longer be a beacon of salvation and their time in the Son came about by the rejection of my kinsman and people for they shouted in unbelief release to us Barabbas! But as the mysteries of Yahweh were revealed by my holy apostles and prophets, I have restrained Barabbas and not released him fully, but only allowed the mystery of iniquity to progress. And now the times have come where I will fully release Barabbas as my restrainer is removed and as my faithful, called, and chosen are taken into the heavens where I have prepared their permanent dwellings, and they will be clothed in fine spotless linen that never can be soiled or tainted.
Are you so blind to your world, and so deaf of hearing that you no longer hear my voice oh Laodicean Church? You have believed the lies brought about by the mystery of iniquity, and you have allowed toxic leaven into your corrupted Bibles that have brought absolute corruption into your Churches that have

contaminated your own hearts with fables in erroneous unbelief. You allowed the lies of dispensational wizards to enchant you with false texts and lying words. You no longer understand scripture, and you have heaped to yourselves great troubles that will come upon you suddenly. Every Word of God is pure and is intended for the obedience of faith and edification of the recipients. Understand the Words of my Words and understand the times you live.
For I had John the Revelator write: And I saw a beast rise out of the sea, having seven heads, and ten horns, and upon his horns were ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
And again John the Revelator wrote: I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads, and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold, and precious stone & pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.
And again: And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman, which thou saw, is that great City which reigns over the kings of the earth.
My Children, understand that beast can refer to individuals and also to kingdoms, study to learn. The beast that carries the harlot will destroy the harlot and will be in subjection to the harlot no longer, for she has ruled the kings of the earth in her fornication. So the beast to rise out of the sea will produce their expected Mahdi, but will also utterly destroy Mystery Babylon, for God has given the great whore into the hands of her enemies who already utterly hate her.
Before the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth rise fully in the dragon’s Kingdom, there are many rulers who are united in purpose to give their power and rule to the dragon, for God has put it in their hearts to accomplish. And they will destroy mystery Babylon. Do you think you have mastered my holy scriptures because you have believed your lying theologians? Understand and hear the Words of your Lord!
Again, I had John the Revelator write: And the beast which I saw, was like a Leopard, and his feet like a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his throne, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered and followed the beast.
My Children, the words of Yahweh have multifaceted depth, of which no man can master. The beast described is an empire who will rise from the destruction of the harlot, and out of the old order will the new order rise! It represents the beast of the sea, for he will rise as their Mahdi, and it represents the nature of the kingship with he will rule the sea. Why do you not respect the words of my Word? It does not say that the beast from the sea himself was wounded, for what man literally has seven heads? But one of his heads as it were wounded to death. Oh, fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken! AS IT WERE wounded to death. The Words “as it were” should stop you in your tracks, but you don’t even believe the least of my words any longer, and I am the Word made flesh. Is it not clear to you, AS IT WERE, is an age-old idiom? Is it not clear to you that “were” is subjunctive? Is it not clear to you that it is a shortening of, as if it were so?
But no, you believe the lies of the dragon, for Barabbas speaks as a dragon, but he is not Barabbas, but the

beast from the earth. And so now all the world will wonder after the beast on account of his lying signs and wonders, and he will perform many more lying signs and wonders, and he has not risen fully for the harlot is not yet burned with fire, but he is now revealed in his time. He speaks as a dragon, saying “God alone saved him from his head wound” and this is a blasphemous lie. Yahweh, the great eternal God, has sent me Jesus the Nazarene as the savior of the world. I and my Father are one in unity and purpose and Yahweh did not save Barabbas and neither did I, Christ Jesus. You have been deceived and taken and ensnared in great deception, and I say to you repent and return to your first love and do so now, for there is no time!
For I am he who tries the hearts, and I am he who tests all who I call to salvation, for I purify all in the refiners fire! Behold! I am he who sits as a refiner and purifier of silver: and I purify the sons of Yahweh, and purge them as gold & silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Do you not understand that I will make you priests and kings before my Father? Even though my gift of holy spirit, whereby you are born again of incorruptible seed is perfect and needs no refining, you are descended from Adam by blood and must fully allow my work to be accomplished in your lives, unless my seed has fallen on stony ground.
Now comes the times of judgment and the times of grace are complete. Even though many will scoff at my words and turn away in unbelief, it is already known by Yahweh the outcome. For Yahweh always proves to mankind his own corrupt ways and reproves mankind of sin, knowing in his love and eternal wisdom that he will save some. And as Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so to will he harden the hearts of many who hear but do not listen. Yahweh will try a person again and again. And some will be like Pharaoh and will harden their hearts further in unbelief but some will depart from the ways of Pharaoh and rise up to eternal life in Christ Jesus, yet through the refiners fire.
Understand that those who choose Barabbas will make themselves partakers of the crimes of Barabbas, and those who refuse to call on my name to the end will all be damned because they had pleasure in unrighteousness. For your new savior is no savior but a ravenous beast. And his system and kingdom are composed of those who hurt the children. Do you not understand the ways of the Dragon? For those who follow the ways of the dragon prey on children. They sacrifice children to Moloch, they seek their fountain of youth from the blood of tortured children, they molest children for their own sick gratification, and they practice the smiting of the embryo in the womb to murder the little ones before birth, and they have secretly led you into their ways, for so are the ways of the leaders of Secret Babylon and also the kingdom of the dragon. And now comes the judgment of God for these things and many more. For had you not seen these things you would have no sin, but now you see and your sin remains.
Have you not read? Thus, says the Lord, A voice was heard on high, a mourning and bitter weeping. Rachel, weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. For you have failed the charge given, and you were entrusted with my mysteries and stood as a light of salvation and a beacon of hope. But now you have joined the ones whom I sent you to stand against. And so now comes the times I will leave you to your future.
Hear me and hear me well all who would reject the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, even the voice of Christ Jesus: you have no time! I counsel you to hear me in my love for you my children and repent now! For the refiners fire is about to fall fully on you, and it will cleanse the land of all the dragon’s kingdom and the earth will be in subjection to Satan’s ways no more and never again will his kingdom rise, for I am Lord

of Lords and King of Kings, and I will utterly destroy the fallen ones. All who refuse repentance will have their part in the lake of fire and will share in the punishment of the devil and his angels in that great lake of burning brimstone. Likewise, all who repent by coming out of sin and calling on my name to the end will be saved and given great eternal reward in me. Behold! Now is the time for the gathering of the faithful, and I will now leave those who refuse to Barabbas, for they have made their choice. I am the son of righteousness and I do rise in my glory I am he who tries the hearts of men I am he whom Yahweh has shared his throne I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I have purchased you in my own atoning, sinless blood I am he who would make you whole, and recreate you anew in my spirit I am he who stands as a beacon of hope for all time I am he who has given grace and mercy to the earth I am the promised seed of the woman and Dan is a lion’s whelp of whom no Messiah shall arise I am the power thereof and in me Yahweh has placed all preeminence I am he who tries the hearts men I am he who tests all whom I call to salvation I am he who sits as a refiner and purifier of silver: and I purify the sons of Yahweh I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I will utterly destroy the fallen ones I am he whom the great I AM has sent and I come to judge and make war Behold! I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have these words been sent! Those who do not turn from this false messiah will either find salvation in the refiners fire, or fall away into oblivion for all time: The choice is yours!

And So the Seasons Change!
JULY 17, 2024
Gather yourselves, my Church, and lend your ears to wisdom. Incline your ears to the voice of your warrior King, even he who stands to fight for you, even me The Lion of the Tribe of Judah who is Lord of Lords and King of Kings. I am he whom Yahweh has given all things in heaven and earth, into my mighty hands for I am alive evermore and hold the keys of death and of hell in my hands, and the earth is mine for I have purchased it in my atoning blood. And I have a name above every name that at the Name of Jesus every knee will bow, both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, unto the glory of the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning. And who can stand against the double-edged sword that proceeds out of my mouth? For with it, I will smite the nations: and I am he who shall rule them with a rod of iron: and I am he who treads in fury the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of El Shaddai even the Almighty God. And I am he who has on my vesture, and on my thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords, and my time has COME!
Whatever is there that can be found amongst Yahweh’s entire creation, my children, that you should fear? Know of a truth, my little ones, that the fallen ones fear you. For they know that they are now as you, and you will be made much more glorious than they once were, even all of those who left their first estate. To depart from the orders that Yahweh sets for his creation is grave sin because Yahweh’s creation is intended to function in harmonious perfection. And Yahweh gives free will, so to chose to rebel in selfish lusts causes death and suffering amongst the tapestry of life. And so the sin of the fallen ones resonates to this day, and the times of their judgment is now! Know you not, my children, that you will judge angels?
Who shall separate you from my love? Will tribulation or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? No! In all of these things you are more than conquerors in me Christ Jesus your ascended and empowered Lord, for Yahweh has shared his throne with me and I will share my throne with the faithful, even those who love me and whom I love. Understand that Yahweh himself fights for you and Yahweh has sent me, even your Lord, King and defender. For I am your strong tower and rock of defense, for I am the Rock of Ages, even your Lord and savior. And I am the refiner who sits with billow and hammer in hand to stoke the fires of purification removing the dross! And I am he who hammers and folds the precious metals of Yahweh’s treasure house, of which his many treasures are the priceless treasures that are the sons of God into glorious perfection, and my works are about to be consummated in you my Children, even my first-fruits and called and chosen and faithful.
Behold! The time has come for the completion and full redemption of you, my loves, and I will complete your redemption and into the eternity of eternities you will now go! And in the twinkling of an eye you will find yourselves standing in Yahweh’s throne room in heavenly surprise and everlasting joy, for you will now enter into the joy of your Lord. And you will find yourselves engulfed in the glorious everlasting light of Yahweh, the great eternal God and the everlasting brightness of the Son of Righteousness and you will be fully recreated, and you will marvel at the splendor with which you will be clothed. My children, every work you have ever performed in my name in service to Christ, in that you have ministered to the saints and do minister, is recorded in the heavens! Eye has not seen, neither ear heard, neither has entered into

the heart of man the things Yahweh has prepared for those who love him and your reward is in my hand, for you are my over-comers, and I have created you newly in me forevermore, and you will never corrupt and yours is an everlasting eternal inheritance that never fades and your glory is eternal. For in that you have been faithful in the tiniest I will make you ruler over much.
In an instant, in a moment of time, in a split second your full redemption will occur and all of your troubles will vanish instantly. Suddenly there will be no more sickness, suddenly there will be no more pain, suddenly there will be no more fear, suddenly you will be in perfect union with Yahweh, suddenly you will be in perfect union with Yeshua HaMashiach, suddenly will you find yourselves full of joy, peace, and everlasting brightness will forever shine from you. For in that you have glorified the Lamb of God, The Lion of the Tribe of Judah will now glorify you, for I am he in whom you have believed, and I am he who is faithful and true, who has kept that which you have committed to me against this day. And you that I have made wise, will forever shine, even as the brightness of the firmament: and you who have turned many to righteousness, will shine as the stars, for ever and ever. So now knowing this my children that now is time to leave the cares of this world and rest in me and stay pure as a virgin in my atoning blood.
Behold! The accuser of the brethren is cast down is cast down, even that old serpent, even that great red dragon whose tail drew a third part of the stars and cast them to the earth. And there was a battle in heaven, Michael and his Angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels. But they prevailed not, neither is their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon, that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, was cast out, which deceives all the world: he is even cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. For there was a flash and a boom and there was shaking and the sign of his presence was felt, and the lies of the forked tongue deceiver are already spread because they have always watched for the coming of his sign. His sign was over his blasphemous statue.
Woe to the inhabitants of the earth for the devil and his angels are cast down amongst you and bound to the earth for judgment and there is no place in the heavens for them evermore and never again shall they enter. Rejoice you heavens, for the accuser of the brethren is cast down which accused them day and night before our God, and his place is in the heavens no more and forever. Now comes salvation, now comes the glory of the saints, and they will be glorified for they shall glorify Yahweh in me Christ Jesus and I will clothe them in everlasting righteousness, even pure white spotless linen that can never be stained, and I will reward them with everlasting reward and will make them Kings and Priest before Yahweh and they will rule from my throne according as their love and faithfulness has been. To the faithful is great reward and to the unfaithful there is loss, but they shall be saved, so as yet by fire.
Hear me, all those who dwell on earth, even though you are deaf and refuse my signs! The devil is now cast down amongst you, and he knows that he has but a short time. He has great anger and vengeance, for he is a defeated enemy bound for the purposes of Yahweh which will be consummated in that fiery cobalt blue lake of continual destruction. And because you, oh natural man love darkness rather than light, because you, oh natural man love your evil works and despise my saving hand of grace, (For every one that practices evil, hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved) so I will now give you the evil you so desire. Because you now live in the tabernacle of Moloch waving the star of your god Remphan on your banner, figures you made to worship them.
Since you sacrifice children to Moloch, since you adore your abominable Baphomet, behold! Your dragon

is now amongst you. And you will learn first hand that the thief comes not but for to steal, kill and destroy. Except now there will be no cloak, there will be no restrainer, there will be no more mercy and grace from the heavens for you have chosen the dragon as your god, and you have chosen Barabbas as your savior and king. So now I give them to rule over you as your evil hearts so desire. Behold! Here is wisdom, let he who has understanding count the number of the beast for it is in the star of Remphan they carry on their banner, for they are the synagogue of Satan who seek to steal the land and kill it’s rightful inhabitants and I will save Jacob!
Behold! Satan enters into Barabbas, and he is taking the reins, and his lying signs and wonders will lead to your utter destruction. For he will use his claims that God alone saved him to claim that he is sent of God and that he is God, for so they believe that they are God in the flesh and all else are animals. He will use his lying signs and wonders and together with the beast from the sea will bring great destruction on the earth, for you have chosen the dragon, and now you will fully eat of the utter filth that the dragon brings.
You, oh dwellers on the earth, you have spit at Yahweh’s grace and mercy that he sent in me, even in the face of Jesus Christ, and since you rejected the Lamb of God, you will now meet the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. For I came in peace and love and goodwill and grace and mercy, and you have foolishly rejected salvation in favor of your own deaths and eternal punishment, for there is no other choice. To spit towards Yahweh when he extends his hand in peace and love, even giving the life of his only begotten son, is eternal sin and there is no escape from wrath except to call on the mighty name of Jesus to the very end and he who loves not his life to the end shall be saved, and a multitude of multitudes will be saved.
But you, oh natural man, you have chosen the pleasures of sin when grace was given you and you were given space to repent. For I have reached out to you, I have reached out to your fathers, I have reached out to your father’s fathers, even back many jubilees now since I first sent my apostles and prophets and the great mystery of God has been proclaimed even to the ends of the earth! And now your rejection is complete, and I accept your final decision, and I am Christ Jesus, and I am he who now declares the times of the Gentiles are over and now comes judgment starting at the house of God. In that your lips have denied Yahweh, even the Lord of Spirits, your appointed inheritance is now in that great lake of fiery, rolling brimstone, and It would have been good for you if you had not been born. You foolishly think you have all the time in the world and that Yahweh will continue to wait until perhaps someday you might turn to righteousness from your detestable sins. And I tell you plainly now, time is up and for many they have forever missed their chance at eternal life and even their chance to be amongst my Bride who will come to be admired by all in that day.
For so is the fate of all who take the mark. And so I announce to the nations once again:
IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND RECEIVE HIS MARK IN HIS FOREHEAD, OR IN HIS HAND, THE SAME SHALL DRINK OF THE WINE OF THE WRATH OF GOD, WHICH IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE INTO THE CUP OF HIS INDIGNATION, AND HE SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB: AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCENDS UP FOR EVER AND EVER. AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT, WHO WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND WHOSOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF HIS NAME.

For the mark surely approaches. It will be the entrance to their society, and they will tell you it is the cure. They will tell you it will bring eternal life, they will tell you that you will never be sick again, they will tell you a multitude of lies so that you take their beastly jab, and they will convince many that it is for their own good. Behold! Fallen ones come posing as aliens with their technologies in their hands. Understand that the mark will make you slave to their technologies, for they will mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. Their beastly mark, even the serpents bite, will utterly decimate all who take their poison and there is no escape.
Behold! And I heard a great voice out of the Temple, saying to the seven Angels, Go your ways, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth: and there fell a noisome, and a grievous sore upon the men, which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped his image. And so this future awaits all who willingly accept their own eternal torment and those who chose the second death. All because you have refused Jesus the Nazarene, who would have saved you to the uttermost. And all who take the mark will have their noisome and grievous sores and all who take the mark will forever be in their inheritance in those fiery flames of blue in the blackness of darkness forever, and yet this fate is willingly chosen by those it is intended and so it will be!
And so the final separation now begins and as there was war in the heavens now there will be war on earth for I will instantly take peace away and instantly will the restrainer be removed and instant madness will break across the earth for evil will no longer be restrained, and I will give to each man according to their works. And so the times of the Gentiles are closed and war is about to break across the earth, and they will reconfigure their borders into the final beast kingdom of which the dragon, beast from the sea and the beast from the earth who also is their false Moshiach will rise and Jacob’s trouble will break across the earth in an instant, and they shall not escape!
Behold! I send my everlasting gospel, for it’s sending has been declared of old by John the Revelator when I had him write: I saw another Angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel, to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. Behold! The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and know that my words will find the eyes, ears, and hearts to all whom they are sent and the Words of the everlasting gospel have been revealed in their time and will be preserved for those they are sent, so hearken to the voice of your True Moshiach! For I am Yeshua HaMashiach!
And so the Words of John the Revelator stand as comfort and a beacon of hope for those who will yet attain salvation:
REVELATION 21:1-7
And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth: for the first heaven, and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem come down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride trimmed for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them: and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be their God with them. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, neither crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the first things are passed. And he that sat upon the throne, says, Behold, I make all things new: and he said unto me, Write: for these words are faithful and true. And he said unto me, It is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the

end. I will give to him that is a thirst, of the well of the water of life freely. He that overcometh, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son I am he whom Yahweh has given all things in heaven and earth I am he who shall rule them with a rod of iron I am he treads in fury the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of El Shaddai I am he who has on my vesture, and on my thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords, and

The Cry of the Innocents!
JULY 23, 2024
Take up a lamentation and weep and howl for the slaughter of the innocents. For they have done no crime, they have lived no lives, nor have they committed any sin, for their untimely departure was from the safety of their mother’s womb, and before they had the chance to take their first breaths they are not!
Take up a lamentation and weep and howl for the lost lives of the innocents and their blood that has been spilled cries to the heavens demanding justice. Behold! The earth reels to and fro and shakes as the tension builds, for the weight of the slaughter of the innocents is great!
Take up a lamentation even for Rachel’s children for thus saith the Lord; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping: Rachel, weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. Though you think this, but a light thing, understand that these sins are not to be ignored and the weight of their punishment is exceeding great and judgment surely is on all those who have committed these sins and rejected my offer of peace!
Hear my words, my people, and incline your hearts to my words and hear my wisdom because judgment is not for you. Understand the utter sorrow and bitter tears of your Lord and savior, even Jesus the Nazarene! For many, many tears, I have continually shed for the slaughter of the innocents. Come out from among her my people and allow me to completely dismantle the works of the devil in your lives in this, and even every matter my children. For my spirit no longer comes to convict you of sin, because you are made the righteousness of God in me because you have accepted my gift of eternal life and my gift of righteousness, whereby you are made righteous, even the righteousness of God in me by my atoning blood and by the spirit of the Living God, even the spirit of sonship whereby you are sealed for the day of redemption, and you are a new creation in me. So fear not!
You are created in righteousness and true holiness and when my spirit within convicts you, it is me Christ Jesus convicting you of righteousness. Yes, I convict you of righteousness so you may live righteously for you are the righteousness of God and you must continue to mortify the flesh, and walk in my spirit for there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit! So understand that judgment is not for you, for each soul whom Yahweh has forgiven in me Christ Jesus will not come to judgment for sins but pass from death to life everlasting because you accepted Jesus the Nazarene, even Yahweh’s peace treaty to all mankind and eternally for all who accept my sacrifice!
Come to me and confess even the sins you have caused yourselves to forget and awake to righteousness and sin not. Come to me and confess your faults, so I may cleanse you of all stain in my atoning blood, and so that the works of the devil may be fully and eternally erased from your lives. Why do you stubbornly hold on to your sins? Why do you seek slumber for relief? Can you hide from the living God when you close your eyes? Do you cleave to the myth of the Ostrich and seek to emulate this myth? I didn’t call you to live the myth of the Ostrich nor to bury your heads in the sand nor to cover your sins in pleasure and forgetfulness. For the Ostrich places its head in the ground to care for the eggs of their unborn, not hide from reality. But I have called you to face the sins of your past and confess them to me that I may heal you and undo the

works of Satan in your lives because he seeks to bind you to his sins and eternally accuse you of folly!
Therefore, continue to confess your sins openly and your faults to one another and understand that as you do your enemies tremble for they see undeniable evidence of your continued salvation and undeniable evidence of their impending destruction and eternal judgment in that great lake where the purest flames of blue will burn forevermore and their worm dies not! So come out from among them and be separate and understand that you have remission of sins. As you continue in your saving relationship with me, Christ Jesus, I will purge you to the uttermost of all of your sins that I may make you to myself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that you should be holy and without blame before me in love. And that you may be clothed in fine linen for so is your immediate future. So understand in me, Christ Jesus, there is no condemnation nor judgment for you my children and my harsh words are not for you but I counsel you to learn of me and understand the gravity of what I have delivered you from because you are redeemed from judgment.
And know that every deed is recorded in the heavens for every creature under heaven who is subject to the great judgment. And I have seen and recorded the words and works of the false prophets, even those who pretend to speak for me and have condoned the slaughter of the innocents for their own pernicious ways. For these are those who are wells without water, even those whose adulteries led to the slaughter of the innocents. Who, instead of repenting of their adulteries and fornications they instead murdered their unborn so they could continue feeding on my flock instead of feeding my flock, and they will face great wrath for their crimes for it is impossible for ravenous wolves to hide in the pulpit from my eternal gaze, and they will bear their judgment all who will not repent from these actions!
And so I speak to you natural man, and I speak to you Secret Babylon. For you are guilty of the blood of the innocents, even those you have taken from the safety of their mother’s womb. You have wrapped the smitings of the embryo in false justification and rationalization that make your selfish temptation to murder the innocents as common place as a doctor’s visit, and your clinics of murder are a stench in my Father’s nostrils, and a stench in my nostrils. For the blood of the innocents cries from the earth all the way to the throne of Yahweh in the heaven of heavens who sees all, even all you who seek to hide from his everlasting gaze. And I Yeshua HaMashiach am sent of my Father in judgment, and I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, for you have rejected the Lamb of God and now comes your judgment. And I will utterly cleanse the land of your murderous ways and you will eat of the filth of your own evil ways, for Yahweh has declared a double portion of judgment on you, oh Secret Babylon.
For you have murdered the innocents, ignorantly thinking that this heinous act is a light thing. You have sold your unborn children for filthy lucre that you may advance your careers, even your careers in utter futility for they will all come to naught and your highly prized worldly endeavors of futility will all vanish in judgment never to be remembered. For you have willingly murdered your unborn children in an unwitting sacrifice to Moloch, and you murder own your unborn with great pride. And so it will be, for pride goes before a fall and a haughty spirit before destruction and your judgment and destruction lingers not but is upon you and is already underway and the birth pangs are non-stop now.
But instead of repentance, instead of coming to me, Jesus the Nazarene in humility when I have offered you life eternal and remission of sins and the consequences stemming from corresponding judgment you have chosen instead your sins and own eternal punishment. You have committed yourselves to and chosen

instead of me Jesus the Nazarene, Barabbas, your false Moshiach. Instead of Yahweh the great eternal God, you have chosen the dragon as your god and I will now give you over to them for you have joined their ways in your arrogance and pride and you will now eat of the filth of your own ways.
You have sacrificed the blood of the innocents on the altars of self gratification, and you shed your smitten embryos as if they were impure rags tossed aside into medical waste bins, and you have accounted the spirit of life that is in the blood an unholy thing and your judgment is on you. But your very own, even your unborn children, were out of style with your ever fading fashions and their lives were a hindrance to you fully enveloping yourselves in the pleasures of sins.
You justify and demand the blood of the innocents in your murderous political ideologies, and you knowingly have joined the fallen ones in their rebellion, for it was the Satans who taught the smitings of the embryo in the womb, even your precious murderous procedures you are so proud to protect and flaunt. And so the blood of the innocents cries from the earth and the weight of your sins have caused the earth to wobble like a drunken man, and great will be the shaking and great will be the fall! Babylon the Great is Fallen is Fallen!
Oh natural man, Oh Secret Babylon, how you have fallen from the grace and mercy that I undeservedly bestowed on you. And though my grace and mercy is not in vain, for Yahweh’s purposes, even his purposes hidden in the great mystery of God have been fulfilled in the Gentile nations and their times are completed. And I am he who will now turn to save Jacob from destruction, for they will turn to me as their Messiah, even all that Yahweh himself has called from eternities past to walk before him as one new man in me Christ Jesus, and one new nation and never again will the Israel of God be divided and there will be no more sea. But first the lands must be cleansed and Satan’s kingdom will be utterly destroyed, never to rise again. Oh foolish, evil and corrupted natural man, even you who has not my spirit and he who has rejected life eternal in me Christ Jesus.
Understand that children are the Lord’s heritage, and it would be better for a person to never be born than to harm the innocent ones before their first breath; to harm even one of my little ones is grievous and carries eternal punishment. But nevertheless you continue. Even though I have inspired many to stand outside your clinics to try and stop you from sealing your own fates. But you would have none of it, and you have rejected my warnings and now will suffer your judgment.
You have gone astray into the ways of Baal and you have become just as Satan has led you, for you are beyond all feeling in your nihilistic ways. Do what you will is the whole of their law that you have made your very own. You have been led astray into the ways of the Canaanite, for they sacrificed their children as well, with great pride and joy, just as you continue to do! But in your arrogance you think you are nothing like those foolish and unlearned ancients and your ways are superior to these ancient barbarians, yet you practice the same. But you foolishly think you are different, and you seek to use willing ignorance as a cloak, and you seek to rationalize and hide your sins in your spurious educations that have led you to judgment. For the weight of the innocent blood cries to the heavens even now and demands justice, and Yahweh has heard their cries!
You have unknowingly given your unborn to further the beast system, and the fallen ones have accepted your sacrifices. They have used the blood of the innocents as they always have in the making of their abominations, and so in the days of Noah so will it be. For when the restrainer is removed, then you will

THE

understand the sheer enormity and number of their abominations, for they will be released completely unrestrained.
You have sacrificed the blood of the innocents and the abominations they have made will hound you and pursue you to the ends of the earth for they have always eaten the inhabitants of the land and the evil tares made by the hands of the fallen ones have no forgiveness for their sins and crimes against Yahweh, for mankind is made in the image of Yahweh and to desecrate the life of the flesh that is in the blood is grave sin and will not be overlooked for those who have refused my salvation during my times of grace and mercy. Behold! I send giants to fulfill my wrath!
I will now speak to the fallen ones, and they do hear and they do tremble! Your ways have caused your utter eternal and everlasting destruction for yours is an everlasting destruction where you will have each sin returned to you many times over. Each life you have taken in your greedy and lust filled evil ways will be recompensed to you a hundred times over. For you have used the blood of the innocents in your rites, and practices, and rituals and many abominations have you made as you played god! But you are no gods and you cannot deliver your selves from my hand, for I Christ Jesus am the promised seed of the woman who will utterly crush your head!
Now comes your judgment and imminent destruction. For you have not only shed the innocent blood, even me Jesus the Nazarene, but you are guilty of the blood of the innocents even from the first to the last for it is you who taught the smitings of the embryo that it may pass away. Your abominable ways and actions will be fully recompensed to you for all eternity and you will never escape nor will you have a moments rest from your eternal punishment. For it is you that are responsible for the death and destruction of the innocents and all who have followed your destructive ways in unrepentant hate will share in your inheritance of eternal fire as you pay for each and every detestable act you have committed against Yahweh’s creation. For the very same things you have done to others will be given into your bosoms many times over even for the eternity of eternities and you will not escape.
For you tried to steal my inheritance from me, except you failed for you tried the impossible: You tried to kill the innocent blood, even me Jesus the Nazarene, for it is impossible that death should hold me. For I gave my life willingly and no one took it from me, but I laid my life down willingly as the perfect Passover for all time. And I, even Christ Jesus, will undo all of your evil works in the lives of your victims, even those who have come to me in repentance of your vile ways and those who will call on my name to the end, for a GREAT multitude will yet be saved. Even every soul whom Yahweh has ordained for eternal life from the foundations of the earth and you will not pluck even the least of these from my eternal hands, oh failed dragon. For the innocents you have murdered will spring alive into newness of eternal life and eternal joy in the presence of Yahweh and forever will they live in everlasting joy and they shall enjoy the fat of the land! For what has Yahweh Promised?
Behold! Thus saith the Lord, A voice was heard on high, a mourning and bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. Thus saith the Lord, refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears: for your work shall be rewarded, says the Lord, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy: And there is hope in your end, says the Lord, that your children shall come again to their own borders.
Behold! I, even Yeshua HaMashiach will raise to life all the lost innocents and I will fully avenge their

blood on the guilty! I will raise them to eternal life and the lives of the unborn will spring forth into eternal life and eternal joy and I will reconnect them to the redeemed, even those whom I have shown mercy who came to me in repentance and I will restore to them what you have taken, oh fallen ones. And theirs will be an everlasting joy and I will restore the murdered innocents to their families and Yahweh himself will be their Father and they will take their places amongst the everlasting tribes and they will be avenged even on your own worthless heads!
Behold! They will be made powerful, and glorious, and the innocents have a special place in the heart of Yahweh and his purposes will be fulfilled in their eternal lives and forever will they shine before their Father and their God and they will come to be forever glorified in me Christ Jesus who will resurrect them and fully restore their lives that were stolen before they even had the opportunity to breathe.
So take comfort Rachel, for your children will be restored and rest under my mighty hand of comfort knowing that your little ones will ever be alive evermore and never will they perish, for I Yeshua HaMashiach have so declared and nothing can change my declaration. And Yahweh the great eternal God does rise in anger and judgment and judgment will now fall!
Why do you seek to return to sleep my called and chosen? What I have promised I will deliver for I come in the power and glory of Yahweh the great eternal God and I am one in unity and purpose with my Father, even El Shaddai the great eternal God for there is none like him! Understand that my appearing is approaching and is now even at your door! Time is out for Secret Babylon to repent and her judgment is already underway. Suddenly when the restrainer is removed and my people are raised and changed to meet me in the air, sudden destruction will fall on the ungodly and they will not escape and the blood of the innocents of all time will be fully avenged forevermore in the day of the great judgment, and so now great judgment will fall. Comfort one another with these Words, for you are saved from wrath my Church, even my Bride!
I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have these words been sent!
I counsel all of the unrepentant to accept salvation by grace before the door to the Ark is sealed shut. You have no time, so make me Lord now knowing that Yahweh raised me from the dead!
And all who are left to the refiners fire I counsel to call on my name to the end and accept not their mark, and you will be saved into everlasting joy!
I am he who is coming in fiery vengeance
I am he who is worthy to loosen the seals.
I am he who protects, fights for, and resurrects those who never had a voice
I am sent by the great I AM
I am coming in the clouds and all shall see my glory
Time is up!

Reject The Mark of the Beast!
JULY 27, 2024
Hear the voice of wisdom and bow the knee and hear the living voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, for I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords! El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, has highly exalted me and given me a name above every name. That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth: And that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father of Lights, even Yahweh, the everlasting and eternal God, for there is none like our Father!
Hear the voice of your Lord and understand things that are already underway and things that are soon to happen, for behold I am he who speaks of things to come as if they have already occurred for surely your great Lord, even me Christ Jesus the preeminent one will do nothing, except I reveal my secrets to my servants the Prophets. Why do you hearken to so many contradictory voices, and why halt you between two opinions? Have I not stated that my prophets speak in unison and will never contradict my holy Words?
For I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you by my holy spirit that is born within you forevermore, for each and every soul who is born again is sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is my incorruptible seed and the seal of the Living God cannot be broken. And the day of redemption of the purchased possession is at hand and your full redemption is here.
Thus says the Lord of Hosts, hear not the words of the prophets who prophesies to you, and teaches you vanities: they speak the vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. Come to me my children because the anointing which you have received of me, abides in you: and you need not that any man teach you: But, as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is true, and is no lie: and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in me. My children abide in me and compare the words of anyone who claims to speak for me with scripture and ask me to confirm in your spirit, if perhaps you will listen to my voice for many of you are hard of hearing, and many of you love false words that tickle your ears so you may appear wise but instead follow the false words of presumptuous fools.
Behold! I speak of the times of Jacob's trouble that is ready to break across the entire earth. For judgment is already underway and cannot be stopped, for what Yahweh declares can no one change! Many, many tears have I cried over Mystery Babylon’s judgment and I have sent my prophets for many, many years now and have even sent strangers from strange lands to witness and prophecy of the judgments that were approaching but are now here.
For so it will be for so it is written: The ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman, which thou saw, is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.
Hear my words, Secret Babylon’s judgment is already underway. The ten horns have prepared their surprise attack and their attack approaches and is at your door. For even your media seeks to soothe you to sleep and many sit in darkness blind to reality saying: I sit as a Queen and am no widow and will see no mourning.

Tomorrow will be as today, for today is as yesterday. In as much as she glorifies herself, and lives in pleasure, so much give to her torment and sorrow: Therefore shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for Yahweh who condemns her, is the Almighty God and there is none greater and there is nothing that can stop El Shaddai’s mighty hand!
And so the sun will soon rise on a day of calamity you do not expect, and that day is nearer than you imagine. And that day will bring utter destruction on Mystery Babylon, for she has a double portion of judgment declared against her. Her crimes and fornication are many and her penalty lingers not and great punishment will fall on the unrepentant even as my faithful Church and even my faithful Bride will be gathered to me suddenly in the clouds and saved from wrath, even the great trouble of Daniel’s seventieth week. Babylon the Great is Fallen, is Fallen! Hear my words for I speak as if it is already happened for nothing will change, slow, hinder, nor stop Yahweh’s judgments from crashing onto the earth.
In one hour she will be burned with fire, some of her cities will burn, some of her cities will be violently flooded, her towers will fall and break in many pieces, her bridges will fall, and much shaking will occur. The earth will be torn asunder violently and much land will be covered over in violent waters. Her skirts will be covered from the east and from the west in great waves and up the middle rushing waves and violent shaking. Of what remains will be a wasteland and never again will she rise, for this nation of many states and many cities shall never rise again and great will be her fall! For the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, and all aspects of her evil influence will forever be erased from the nations during Daniel’s seventieth week, for so I will cleanse the earth in my wrath. I, Christ Jesus, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, have declared these words, and preparation for their fulfillment is already underway and will suddenly be fulfilled in one hour.
And so war will break across the earth as part of the surprise attack on Secret Babylon, for this is planned and coordinated for many jubilees now, for the mystery of iniquity has been at work since the days of old and will reach full consummation once the restrainer is removed as my faithful are taken into the heavens. War will fall across the earth and will come onto all peoples and all nations, for this is the third such war, as the fallen ones seek to destroy the old orders of the world and replace all things with their new order, even the order of the Dragon. The beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will rise in great fury, and they will make war with the saints, for it is given to them to overcome the saints. So it will be that all who love not their lives and call on the name of the Lord till the end shall be saved into everlasting joy into the eternity of eternities. And I Jesus the Nazarene have left an eternal example of obedience unto death, for my obedience to Yahweh was even the death of the cross as I suffered and paid for the sins of mankind as the lamb of God and behold I am coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and I will not be stopped nor hindered!
And so my two prophets who are the two olive trees and two candlesticks who stand before the God of the earth will prophesy for 42 months clothed in sackcloth, for they were taken into the heavens in the times of old. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, stopping the rain in the days of their prophecies: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
Theirs is an everlasting testimony, and they will declare the everlasting gospel, and they will speak of the

plans of Yahweh for all times, and they will speak for me Christ Jesus, and many mysteries will they reveal and they will turn the hearts of many to the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning. They will witness of me Yeshua HaMashiach for it is I that Yahweh has sent to Israel to fulfill the promises made to their Fathers and I am the true Messiah now and forevermore and of my kingdom there is no end! For what times have ever been where Yahweh has left himself without witness? There has NEVER been a time Yahweh has left himself without witness, and all who are ordained to everlasting salvation will come to be saved into everlasting eternity and everlasting joy, for the fulfillment of all things is already underway.
And so the beast from the sea will rise as well as the beast from the earth, who is also the false prophet. And he will open his mouth speaking great blasphemies against Yahweh to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. And it will be given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power will be given to him to rule every kindred, and tongue, and nation for he will lead the world. The beast from the earth will also rule the land as their false Moshiach and will be their temple builder. The beast from the sea will rule according to their blasphemous Noahide laws as they seek to eradicate anything to do with the true God and his only begotten son Jesus Christ from the face of the earth.
The beast from the earth will cause the earth to worship the beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he will do great wonders to deceive them that dwell on the earth, for it will be permitted for him to do many lying signs and wonders, and he will cause fire to come down on the earth in the sight of men and he will lead all men to wonder after them. But he is an adversary, and exalts himself against all that is called God, or that is worshiped: so that he does sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
And he will make an image of the beast and will cause all to worship the image which he will make. And it will be permitted to him to give a spirit to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should speak and will cause all who will not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he will make all, both rich and poor, free and slave, to receive his mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.
And so I say again to those who dwell on the earth that all may hear:
IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND RECEIVE HIS MARK IN HIS FOREHEAD, OR IN HIS HAND, THE SAME SHALL DRINK OF THE WINE OF THE WRATH OF GOD, WHICH IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE INTO THE CUP OF HIS INDIGNATION, AND HE SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB: AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCENDS UP FOR EVER AND EVER. AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT, WHO WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND WHOSOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF HIS NAME.
The world that now is will never be again, and the rising kingdom of the Dragon will be utterly cast down, as Satans kingdom moves towards its final end, for they are squatters and they are no kings. And this is the world that many will find themselves, even those who survive the coming cataclysms and war. Take not the mark my people, for they will come offering peace, they will come offering safety, they will tell you it’s all for your own good. They will launch their so called pandemics for they have already planned to convince the world they are sick. And all manner of pestilence and disease and plagues will abound for so are the

effects of the coming horseman and they will ride!
They will offer health and healing from the judgments of God, when instead man should repent of his wickedness. They will offer entrance into their society from the awful judgments that are about to break across the earth. For I Christ Jesus will tell you before it happens that you may know the sincerity of my words and that you may navigate the perilous waters of which many will find themselves, even those with the courage to call on my name to the end, for they are heirs of eternal salvation. For all who call on Jesus the Nazarene as their Lord, even all who call on my mighty name and love not their lives till the end, will be saved into everlasting life.
Have you not read? These are they which will came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
However, even though a multitude of multitudes will be saved from Daniel’s seventieth week and salvation will come to Israel for yet a remnant will bow to me Yeshua HaMashiach, for I am the true Messiah in whom the lamb of God will give way to the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and they will both be consummated in everlasting harmony in me, for in me Christ Jesus the Lion will lie down in peace with the lamb. Sadly, and unnecessarily, most of the world will wonder after and follow these beastly rulers, for they will enchant many. With their witchcraft and enchantments they will seduce the world to accept their poison, and they will permanently poison those who love the world with their sorceries, for the mark of the beast will be disguised as medicine. Even the serpents bite of which their system has already been rolled out and tested, and the masses have already been conditioned to accept their mark and their operation war seed was a success.
And so their system is ready for prime time, and they have prepared their social scores and all will be controlled who live in their cities and their society. For they will have to take the mark of the beast to participate in their satanic society, even the kingdom of the Dragon. Those who take the mark will be forever altered. Their very genetics will be altered, for they will mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. Their beastly mark, even the serpents bite, will utterly decimate all who take their poison and there is no escape.
Even all of those who take the mark will be forever altered, and they will find themselves part of their system, and they will be intertwined by technologies and their minds will no longer be their own. They will be controlled and will be as the walking dead, they will be forever slaves to the hive mind of their system, even of their technologies for they will be meshed together with the Internet of things to be. They will lose their own will, and they will have no feeling and anything of God will forever be erased from them for they will alter themselves into an unredeemable state, and they will fully and forever join themselves to the fallen ones and forever will belong to the dragon and to the great lake of fire will they go forevermore. And so will be the fate of their own choosing.
For the finality of their choice is irrevocable. And their plagues and sores and sicknesses will be many, and even though they will be promised health and peace, health and peace they will never have. Because Satan

endeavors to use his sorceries to fight against the wrath and judgments of God and to poison and kill the masses, but no relief will they have and those who partake of his sorceries will never escape. Those who take the mark will glow under their dark lights, and their lights will line the streets of their cities they have prepared for their slaves. Understand that these will be the walking damned who have no forgiveness and who can never recover, for these are those whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb, slain from the foundation of the world. And no salvation will ever be had amongst them nor in their society, for to walk among them and join their society will absolutely require the mark of the beast.
My two witnesses will testify until the times of their testimony are completed for 42 months is given. And so it will be given to the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit to make war against them, and he shall overcome them, and kill them, even my two olive trees, and two candlesticks when they have finished their testimony. And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also your Lord was crucified. And the wicked will make great celebration and give gifts to one another on account of their deaths. And after three and a half days the Spirit of life from God will enter into them: and they will stand upon their feet, and great fear will fall upon all which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies will behold them ascend into the heavens into everlasting life and forever will they be changed. And the seventh Angel will sound, and there will be great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.
(Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.)
And so the greatest tribulation ever will begin, even though tribulation is constant during Daniel’s seventieth week. And their temple will be finished and the abomination of desolation will be accomplished by their false Moshiach. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of the abominations, he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
These will be the darkest times my children, for I Yeshua HaMashiach do tell you these things before they happen, and they are written as a warning to all. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and they will do many mighty works for me. For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet and the trumpet is about to sound.
These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen and their abilities will embody their accomplishments and great abilities will they possess for they are faithful called and chosen even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.
My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion and I will lead them. They will take those I lead them to into

the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies’ kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the dragon for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety, they will heal them from their wounds, they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so they will complete that in which I will lead them.
And when the times are accomplished so it will be, even as it is written and as it is written so let it be done: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.
And so I, even Jesus the Nazarene, even the Lamb of God, even Christ Jesus who is also the Lion of the Tribe of Judah will come to judge and make war on the Dragon and all his kingdom will be utterly smashed never to rise again. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into the lake of fire and Satan will be chained with a great chain in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and so my millennial reign will begin and in righteousness will my rule be. Behold! I bring my bride and a host of kings and priests with whom I will rule the earth in righteousness and I will rule the nations with a rod of iron. So have great hope my children for the consummation of all things is at hand and this seven year period of great trouble, even Jacob’s trouble will be followed by my righteous rule and Yahweh will be all in all.
And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth: for the first heaven, and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy City, new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent!
I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah
I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords!
I am he who speaks of things to come as if they have already occurred
I am the Word made flesh who dwells among you by my holy spirit that is born within you forevermore
I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek
I am he who is a light to the Gentiles and is the savior of the nations for all who have made me Lord
I am he whom the Great I AM has sent for the salvation of Israel, for a remnant of Jacob will yet be saved.

Woe to Those Who Call Darkness Light and Light Darkness!
JULY 31, 2024
Hear the words of your Lord and savior my Church, even my Bride, for I am he who gives wisdom to the wise, that the wise among you may yet be wiser still. And I am the smith who stokes the fires of purification, so hear my words one and all, and bow the knee to my invitation to eternal life and seek wisdom for wisdom is the principle thing, therefore get wisdom. So come to me with open heart and open arms and bow the knee and continue to make me, Jesus the Nazarene, your eternal Lord for I still am calling all who are heirs of everlasting life, though some are hard of hearing.
But reject the wisdom of this world which comes to nothing, for the wisdom of the world is from the princes of the world who all will very soon be bound for a thousand years in the abyss in torment and punishment for their ways. For even in the heavy chains of which they will shortly be bound they will understand their future, and they will tremble and quake for a thousand years as their appointed eternity in that ever burning lake of putrid brimstone rolls and burns in the hottest flames of cobalt blue for so Yahweh has prepared and so their inheritance awaits them.
For so is their heart’s desire for the children of the living God, so Yahweh will turn their heart’s desire back into their own bosoms, and so they will forever burn over and over into the eternity of eternities. For especially the fallen ones will receive of their own ways for they are the father’s of sin, transgression, iniquity, and lawlessness and their abominable acts will be given back to them eternally. And they will know and fully pay for every single sin they have ever committed many times over and over and over will their punishment be, for so has been found in their hearts and their actions are forever and eternally detestable. For so are the ways of Yahweh, in what manner a person judges another, so shall indeed they be judged and so is the fate and punishment of all who choose their own destruction instead of eternal life in me Jesus the Nazarene for I am the Lamb of God.
For whoever is foolish enough to rebel against the order of creation, even the natural orders of Yahweh who designed life as an interrelated tapestry, will share in their punishment. To rebel against the orders of life is to bring death and destruction to others, and great evil and great harm are accomplished by all who rebel in such fashion and who follow their own lusts to the detriment of others. To revel in the fallen one’s rebellion is to join their ways and all who do will forever share in their inheritance in everlasting flames, and there is no other choice.
For of old and since the beginning mankind has been given free will and Adam was enticed by Eve who took from the serpent who beguiled her in his craftiness. So Adam and Eve chose death as the consequences for sin, for men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them.
And so the knowledge of good and evil has corrupted all who have eaten ever since. And the seed war has roared and raged ever since Genesis and the promised seed of the woman, in much destruction, and in this war has nothing been spared from its consequences. To this very day the entire creation travails and groans in pain even now because the creation also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, and deliverance lingers not! But understand my children that to

this very day the seed war is won fully in me, Christ Jesus, For you are born again of an incorruptible seed and in the lamb of God was atonement made for the sins of mankind once and forevermore. And by the immeasurable power of Yahweh, death was conquered for all time in my resurrection from the dead, for it is impossible that death should hold me for I am sinless and the wages of sin is death.
Yet I paid an unimaginable price for your deliverance and freedom, and the sons of the living God will at any moment find themselves standing in the throne room of God clothed evermore in eternal life. So it is and so it will be, that whoso calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved eternally and forevermore, should they remain faithful in calling on my name to the end. For the fallen ones are defeated enemies, and now comes the times of utter destruction on their kingdom and complete punishment as the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of God are poured out in the days to come. For the day of the Lord is here, so hearken to my voice before the door to the Ark is closed.
Hear my words and understand my speech. For I speak of things currently under way and even a great deception that would deceive the very elect should they choose to close their ears to my voice. I will now speak of the feral pigs who seek to appear as though they are not in the pens they have been kept by my restrainer. Even the procession and orders of pigs that advances destruction day by day bringing the earth ever closer to total war, and total calamity, for so is given them to accomplish and God has put it in their hearts to fulfill his will for even Yahweh’s enemies obey his voice.
The pigs roll in their own filth, rooting in the mire, and never are they satisfied, but will devour whatever they can as they root with their snouts to the earth for they are of the earth, and they are blind to all else but the impulse of their belly and the lusts of their father they will do. For so are the current leaders of the land, and they cry out in pain as they strike their victims. For nothing can fully satisfy these pigs, and they are utterly poisoned from the inside by their consumptions, for they are all unclean and are true tares and so is their nature.
These evil beasts are corrupt trees and without fruit, twice dead, and plucked up by the roots. They will never have eternal life, and theirs are the ways of eternal death and destruction, even perpetual destruction in the inheritance of their Fathers in that great lake of fiery blue. They are invasive in nature, and they ingratiate themselves at first seeking shelter as they cry the victim, even accusing other’s of the hate they perpetrate on the nations. They cry out in pain as they strike those whom they would destroy so they may seem justified in their evil ways.
For these brute beasts cannot be pitied for theirs are the ways of destruction and these will do the lusts of their Father the devil for his lusts are their pleasure and so are they fulfilled. Woe to those who celebrate evil and who call light darkness and darkness light. For theirs are the ways of destruction, and from the eternal fires they will never escape. Understand my children that at any moment now the pigs will be freed from the pens in which they have been kept by the restrainer. For as the restrainer is removed, these seemingly domesticated and harmless pigs who pretend to be God’s chosen will turn feral as soon as they are released from the restrainers unbreakable grip, for so is their true nature.
They will invade many lands and will consume all they find. They will feed on the death and destruction of others, for so is their nature. They have roamed from place to place, and they have their orders and social structures, for Yahweh even gives a level of intelligence and order even to the pigs, for Yahweh’s ways are just and righteous. These pigs have no remorse, they have no feeling, and they have no problem eating the

dead even to suit their appetites, and will even eat the living if it suits their purposes. Behold the hour now is where the pigs will be unrestrained and when they are, they will eat the land, they will devour the fat of the land, they will destroy peace utterly from the earth and will feed and roll in the bloodshed of total war. For even your evil entertainers sing of their ways, and their ways are no mystery.
These feral pigs are made for destruction and for consuming the filth of the land to cleanse the earth for the purposes of Yahweh, then they will be bound and cast into the eternal fires forevermore. For their sins are great, and their sins are many. But understand that these pigs have been kept in their pen for the appointed times and many pretend to be appointed as holy vessels for their rising kingdom. And now is the time of their releasing, and they will now show their true nature they have disguised in seemingly pious clothing, and the black cube of Saturn is in the center of their star and even above the eyes. They seek to separate themselves for they have chosen themselves to be God’s own. But no man comes to Yahweh except through me, Jesus the Nazarene, of whom their Father’s rejected and those who have made me Lord are the true Israel of God and will be fully recreated in me as one new man, whether Judean or Gentile, whether bond or free. These Edomite tares will be fully exposed for the frauds they are and they will be utterly removed from the land and all the earth in great judgment and great punishment.
But before they are removed they will be permitted their blood-lust as their true nature is revealed for all to see, for currently they hide themselves in seemingly religious trappings. They feed on garbage, they feed on the dead, they attack and consume the living because their blood-lust is great and cannot be satisfied! And all the while they pretend they are holy, they pretend they are of the land and are rightful heirs, and they pretend not to be invaders for their natural habitat is the wilderness and not the land of promise. And so is the nature of the pig for as soon as they are returned to the wild their true feral nature is fully exposed. Yet, they pretend to live the identities of those they would conquer and they will be utterly rooted out of the land and they have no root nor branch for so Yahweh has promised. So understand these pigs appear benevolent leaders of the promised land when in fact they are ravenous beasts who thrive on genocide and will utterly seek to destroy anything of me, Christ Jesus, and they will even betray those of the Land who follow their Talmudic orders into destruction and yet a remnant of the land will come to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, for I will yet save Jacob!
Woe to those who call darkness light and light darkness! Even those who attack Yahweh, and Yeshua HaMashiach by attacking the children of the Living God. For in that they have done it to the least of one of my brothers they have done it to me, and vengeance is mine, says the eternal Lord, and I will repay. So open your eyes, my children, and reject those who fly the star of Remphan on their banner! Because to join them is to live in the tabernacle of Moloch and to bow before their Baphomet! Have I not told you to reckon the number of the beast and that number is proudly displayed in that figure they made for themselves to worship their star god, for in the center of their star is their cube! Understand this parable, for six points lead to six triangles that make a hexagon and within fits their cube, so reckon the number of the beast and quit believing the lies of the Edomites because they worship the fallen ones and their god is the dragon.
And since the days of Noah, even after the flood, nine tenths of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim have been restrained in the abyss, for Noah prayed for his grandsons who were attacked by them and were overcome of them. And so Yahweh honored the request of Noah and bound the worst and most vile, and nine tenths of their number have been kept in the abyss ever since. Hear me and hear my well, my Children,

and understand the voice of your Lord. At the gathering of the faithful in my Church and even my Bride to me in the clouds the restrainer will be removed, and the abyss is set to be fully opened.
Evil will no longer be restrained, because Yahweh has further restrained the fullness of Satans kingdom so those who are heirs of eternal salvation may be saved, even those who have made me their Lord in my times of grace and mercy. Since mankind has now rejected me, evil will no longer be restrained from mankind. Understand that all, even a huge multitude of these spirits will all be released, even a very great number that will utterly overwhelm the earth with unrestrained and unspeakable evil. For Enoch the scribe wrote regarding these: And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause offenses. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them.
Have you not read in my holy word where I traveled through the country of the Gadarenes? For I cast spirits out of two who were possessed of them, and so I allowed these evil spirits to enter into a nearby herd of swine. Understand that the fullness of the Dragon’s kingdom is about to be unleashed for a short time, in order to drive those who are ordained to eternal life into my saving arms! For these imprisoned spirits will be released to join Satans kingdom fully on the face of the earth. And they will enter into the pigs yet once again. For they do battle with men and would overcome men for their lusts can never be satisfied and these are the spirits who empower the pigs and who work in tandem with the pigs and these feral pigs are their vehicle.
Not only them but all who take their beastly mark will also become willing vehicles for these spirits who will war against mankind yet again. For they will once again devour natural man in these last times, for so it is appointed to happen in these end-times. And the end has already begun and is coming fully so very soon as Jacob’s trouble breaks across the land. The birth pangs are so close now they are non-stop and Yahweh has done many signs in the earth and many signs and wonders in the firmament and in the heavens and in the earth, yet so many still rationalize away these warnings in faithless reasoning.
Behold! Instead of coming to repentance, the masses are even entertained by swarms of insects that have overtaken many and in many lands across the earth. Laughing and giggling at the warnings given by Yahweh to the earth for the eternal God will rise from his habitation and will show himself and the fallen ones do tremble for their times have come, and they are gripped in eternal fear. For you fallen ones thought you could take the eternal God by craft, when such a thing is not possible. For at what time have vessels of dishonor risen up to make war and take the potter by craft? But such is the insanity and arrogance of the fallen ones, and they will not escape their ever burning kiln.
So understand the times you live and remain in me, my Church, even my Bride! For your full redemption and full inheritance lingers not, and you will not be left amongst the pigs because you believed on my name in these days of grace and mercy, and so eternal grace and mercy will you forever have. And your brethren will join you in eternity and in my coming Kingdom of righteousness, even all those who are not ready for my appearing.
For I am the refiner who stokes the fires of purification that I may purify the treasures of Yahweh, removing the dross, and I am he who sits as the smith with billow in hand stoking the coals and who folds and forges the precious metals of Yahweh to produce everlasting and unending strength. A great multitude, even a

multitude of multitudes, will come to me through Jacob’s trouble, and they will reap great reward, and they are heirs of eternal salvation and into eternal joy will they go and Israel will be saved! So fear not my children, and worry not for your loved ones and have faith in me Christ Jesus, for I am able to save to the uttermost all who call on my name, and not one who is ordained to eternal life can be plucked from my hand, and I will save many from the eternal fires, even pulling them from the flames.
I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these words by my servant, and by my servant have these words been sent!
I am he who gives wisdom to the wise, that the wise man may yet be wiser
I am the Lamb of God who is coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah
I am sinless, and yet I paid an unimaginable price for your deliverance and freedom
I am he who sits as the smith who folds and forges the precious metals of Yahweh’s treasures
I am able to save to the uttermost all who call on my name, and not one who is ordained to eternal life can be plucked from my hand
Watch for my appearing, for the times are here. The time remaining is given only to serve Yahweh’s purposes my children, so do not allow yourselves to be soothed to sleep yet once more, even ignoring my words of wisdom and many warnings.
A wise man sees the plague and will hide him self, as for fools they go on still, and suffer harm. Have I not called you to Yahweh’s ever enduring wisdom?
And I am he who will hide you where you could never hide yourselves, for I will hide you away in Yahweh’s throne room even in the heaven of heavens where you will enter into the pleasure of your Lord and the banquet halls of the heavens will celebrate you all, for sooner than you imagine you will see with your own eyes the majestic, eternal splendor that awaits you in your inheritance. Continue still in my love, for you are greatly beloved of my Father and you are the apple of my eye, of whom I am not ashamed to call you my brethren.
I Yeshua HaMashiach have spoken and sent these words and so they are recorded and The Everlasting Gospel has been revealed in it’s time.

Take Up a Lamentation for Secret Babylon!
AUGUST 03, 2024
Hear my words and hear the voice of one crying in the wilderness! I am calling, I am calling, will you hear me? Hold your sin filled tongues in silence and bow the knee in repentance and hear my eternal voice while you still can, for my love for you is great, and I am he who sheds many tears in utter heartbreak for what will come of those who ignore my voice. For even in this last moment all who respond are invited into eternity. So confess me as your Lord, for I am Jesus the Nazarene, and I am he whom the eternal God has sent to rescue you before calamity and judgment strikes. Why do you count yourselves unworthy of eternal life? Will you choose the flames of destruction over peaceful fields of plenteousness where you will find eternal pasture?
For even as the malefactor who was crucified alongside me on Calvary will be with me in paradise, so too will I save you to the uttermost if you will make me your Lord now! THERE IS NO TIME TO WASTE. For I died outside the gates of Jerusalem with the sinners as I took your place in judgment, and you will be saved should you turn to me in repentance right now. I say to you truly, truly: These words did not find your ears by accident, and soon there will be great destruction and many will not survive and forever will their rejection echo into the eternal fires reserved for all who choose to cling to their sins and remain in league with the fallen ones.
To join Satan’s rebellion, even in blind ignorance, is to willingly partake of their sins, and so all who do will forever bear their judgment. Will you accept my offer, knowing God raised me from the dead to die no more and knowing that I am that great Lord of Lords and King of Kings? Repent while you still can, for Yahweh is ready to close the door of the ark, and there is no time and at any second I will snatch the faithful away into the heavens, even all who are saved from wrath in my ever saving and everlasting sacrifice. So declare me, Jesus the Nazarene as your Lord and know that I am alive forevermore for God has raised me from the dead to die no more.
My children, hearken and continue to bow the knee in continued repentance and hear the voice of your Lord Jesus Christ, even he whom Yahweh has sent as the lamb of God. Hear my Words, my Church even my Bride, For as your eternal high priest of the order of Melchizedek I have offered myself as your perfect Passover, and even given my sinless blood to the last drop for your full and utter redemption from your current fallen state and your full redemption is here, so rejoice!
And as many who have received me and confessed my eternal name as their Lord will have eternal life. For I am Jesus the Nazarene your eternal Lord, and I have made all who confessed my name in these times of grace and mercy the eternal sons of God. Behold, what love the Father has given to you, that you should be called the sons of God: for this cause the world knows you not, because it knows not me, Christ Jesus the Lord of Lords and King of Kings. Dearly beloved, now are you the sons of God, but yet it is not made manifest what you shall be: and you know that when I shall be made manifest, you shall be like me: for you shall see me as I am.
My little children, understand that I will be made manifest any moment now as my appearing in the clouds is here. For I, Christ Jesus, will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and

248

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE

The BITTER SWEET

with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then you which are alive, and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet your eternal Lord in the air: and so shall you ever be with your Lord. Will you allow these words to comfort you, my children? Have you allowed Satan to cause you to deny these plain words recorded for all to see? Will you choose to remain amongst the judged in stubborn rebellion? To deny this event plainly recorded in scripture by the hand of my Apostle Paul is to deny me for I am coming to save the faithful from wrath for so are the promises of Yahweh revealed in the great mystery of God recorded by Paul these many jubilees ago.
I counsel you: deny me not, and get on the ark before it is too late. For all who choose to abide in the coming judgments will come to me by calling on my name to the end, and many will suffer to their last breath. But yet they will rise into eternal life and great reward and everlasting joy! And so all who are called to eternity will come to their everlasting inheritance, for none can pluck even the least of you from my eternal hands. So hear my words and remain in the single-mindedness that is in me, Christ Jesus, because I am the Word of God made flesh and I always speak truth. Quit listening to the many faithless voices who deny my Words or you will find yourselves left among them when such a thing is not necessary.
For you my saved ones, even you are now the Children of the Living God, even Yahweh’s own by way of and in the miracle of the new birth have you been eternally saved and you are born again of incorruptible seed. Yet, you are strangers and sojourners in foreign lands, and many of you are within the borders of that great harlot, even the lands that are in chains waiting for it’s full judgment and destruction: For a double portion of judgment has been declared on Secret Babylon and so shall it be. For at which time has Yahweh not delivered the righteous from Judgment, for no being can rightfully attribute folly to Yahweh, and the witness of Lot testifies to this very day. Even out of the detestable lands of Sodom and Gomorrah did Yahweh send his Angels to rescue this one righteous man who sat in the gates of the enemy’s city.
And so too will I deliver my faithful Church, even all those I have sealed with that holy spirit of promise since the day of Pentecost at the birth of my Church recorded in the testimony of Acts! (Have you not read?) And all who have died faithful in Christ since the beginning of my Church age and all who are alive and remain will be gathered together in the twinkling of an eye and forevermore will they be with me! For I am he who is coming for my faithful, called, and chosen, even my Body and my Church and even my Bride. I will redeem the faithful, even those who have walked according to my spirit and all who have repented of their sins and have made me Lord from a faith filled heart for they are the Israel of God! And great will this coming event be and great will be the shaking and with many signs my approaching has been announced and is still heralded forth across the heavens with signs above and signs in the earth below. And so shall the gathering of the first-fruits be for all to see and behold in astonishment!
And so my voice still echoes through this fallen world, finding the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent. Do you hear the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, do you recognize my voice? Will you receive my words? Can you hear me as I speak to your heart? For as it is written: this people’s hearts have become fat from over consumption, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. Many of these have been lulled to sleep by the detestable yet soothing words of another Jesus, but rest assured there is no other.
For in whatever language my name is called, I Jesus the Nazarene, even Yeshua HaMashiach, will hear

and will save to the uttermost all who call on my name to the end. For my words of wisdom, even the everlasting gospel have been revealed and echo their way across the earth. And my words do find those to whom they are sent, for so are the Words of the Most High God, even Yahweh, for not one Word of God returns void, and they will accomplish that which they are intended and blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear and your hearts are full of faith, and I have saturated the love of God into your very hearts whereby you cry Abba Father! You are the sons of God and it does not appear what you will be, but when I appear you will see fully and your lives are hidden in me, Christ Jesus, and your lives are about to be fully revealed and now is the time of revealing.
Behold! Secret Babylon sits in chains as the ten horns finalize their preparations for her utter destruction. Truly, truly, to Secret Babylon and for many jubilees now have I sent my apostles, have I sent my prophets, have I sent my evangelists, have I sent my pastors, have I sent my teachers, have I sent my faithful disciples and brethren and I have even sent the widows in their solitude, and I have utterly poured out my spirit to the uttermost in these last days of grace and mercy!
But instead of the nations sitting in sack cloth and ashes they are entertained by the signs and warnings given of impending judgment as they take pictures and videos for their entertainment. They have rejected my messengers who brought the light of my gospel of salvation, they have mocked and ridiculed my prophets, they have attacked my evangelists, they have corrupted my pastors, and persecuted and compromised my teachers.
The armies of the great red dragon do surround you secret Babylon and are fully within your borders. For even your traitorous Zionist leaders have sold you for a morsel of bread to your enemies and also to advance their satanic schemes. And El Shaddai has allowed these madmen to continue, even putting it into their hearts to fulfill his purposes. Strong is El Shaddai who judges you, oh scarlet whore who sits arrogantly in pleasure even as you are stripped of all glory, stripped of all delicacies, stripped even of your homes for I have given your homes and lands into the hands of your enemies. Even into the hands of the beast and the false prophet, for they work hand in hand for your utter destruction behind the facade of an old stooge. For the beast is about to cast down the great harlot of which the beast has grown tired of carrying, and her purposes have been served. Therefore, she will be utterly burned, and utterly destroyed in one hour and her destruction lingers not.
For their lines of war, even their red lines given disingenuously to not cross, have been laid down and crossed repeatedly and purposefully. Do not believe their lies, nor their false justifications because they seek to appear righteous in their coming war and the beast and false prophet who have not yet fully risen will rise fully and claim that God’s judgment fell to serve their purposes, so believe not even one of the least of their lies and their final judgment lingers not.
For they will continue and even commit worse sins than Secret Babylon, and they are culpable in leading Secret Babylon fully astray and to her utter destruction, for God has put it in their hearts to accomplish his will. They work in collusion and all those who appear as enemies work together in secret as they play along according to their script and act their parts on the world stage, and they will assassinate all those in their orders who choose not to rehearse and perform their parts adequately to fulfill the purposes of the dragon. For the dragon gives the beasts his power and his throne, and great authority, And the ten horns receive power as kings one hour with the beast and these have one mind, and shall give their power and strength

unto the beast for so is given them by Yahweh for them to accomplish. Pay attention my children and learn of me and follow my ways, for my ways are the ways of Yahweh, the great eternal God!
Understand and pay attention, for these treasonous beasts and evil kings are of the orders of the Dragon and have ruled Secret Babylon from their secret societies since her beginning. The man who dissembles and pretends, even the wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth. Yes they pretend to be others for they are all pretenders, and hidden amongst all nations the tares have been sown. They make signs with their eyes: they signify with their feet: they instruct with their fingers. Lewd things are in their hearts: they imagine evil at all times, and raise up contentions. Therefore, shall their destruction come speedily: they shall be destroyed suddenly without recovery. These six things does the Lord hate: yea, his soul abhors seven: The haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that imagines wicked enterprises, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaks lies, and him that raises up contentions amongst brethren.
Are you blind? Do you refuse to recognize their symbols so you can continue to sit in willful ignorance that your leaders are of the fallen ones? Do you not understand that your entertainers are of the fallen ones? Do you not realize that they are not of the same nature as you, for many have forever altered themselves in their insanity and some are tares from birth and the Devil is their Father? Yet you choose to willingly sit in darkness, and revel and bask in your sins as you roll in the mire with the pigs who have led you to the very gates of hell where many ignorantly parade themselves in vanity and pride. Wherefore I have stated in my letter to Ephesus given to Paul: Awake you who sleeps, and stand up from death, and I, Christ Jesus, shall give you light! Take heed therefore that ye walk circumspectly: not as fools, but as wise. And so I expose these evil leaders of Secret Babylon to my called chosen and faithful that you do not fall victim to their deception and that you may fully come out of her and be separate in all of your ways and that you share not in her plagues.
Hear my words and understand what is happening right now, for their surprise attack is underway. I speak now to Secret Babylon though she is deaf, dumb, and blind and utterly bound in chains for her judgment. As they have prepared their surprise attack for many years now, and they have secured Secret Babylons destruction through usury, and other deceptive means, because even her monetary notes are nothing but an empty promise of debts incurred at the hands of your leaders who serve the money changers and secret Babylon is sold into the hands of their enemies by these crafty means. Do you not understand fractional reserve banking and fiat currency? Study to learn.
Did I not give you an example when I chased the money changers out of the temple? Yet, instead of throwing them out, you invite them in to have supper with your families, and you have pledged your children and your grandchildren as collateral to fulfill your greedy lusts and so your posterity has been merchandised to secure your destruction so you could live the pleasures of sin. You, Secret Babylon, do murder your unborn in great happiness and pride and murderers of the innocents have their appointed judgment and your judgment lingers not. Though a few remaining stragglers are running up the ramp into the Ark before El Shaddai closes the door, most will find themselves left to judgment because they will choose instead to remain outside mocking and living deliciously.
Suddenly, in one hour will her destruction fall suddenly and they will not escape. Since she has given herself in service to her eternal enemies they will now bring about her eternal destruction for never again

will Secret Babylon rise. Oh Secret Babylon, since you have sold your children as surety in pledge for your debts so you could continue in the pleasures of sin (for even your money is usury), since you have murdered the innocents, and much more have you done. I will now give you fully into their hands and Yahweh has even declared a double portion of judgment on you secret Babylon. And many of your children will be sent to their work and reeducation camps and many will be taken to foreign lands for the dragon is allowed claim on the lands and the people who have rejected me, Yeshua HaMashiach, in favor of Barabbas their false Messiah. And many will take their beastly mark and have sold their souls and their posterity to eternal punishment from the presence of the everlasting and eternal God for the pleasures of sin for a short season.
Take up a lamentation for the people of Secret Babylon, even you who sit in darkness and utter ignorance of your own coming destruction. In front of your very own eyes and by consent of your vote and by means of your slothful apathy, your entire nation has been dismantled in front of your very eyes. You no longer have the ability or resources to fight a war, for I, even Christ Jesus, have stripped your military might and given it into the hands of your enemies. Your once great cities now sit in ruins of crime and poverty, of which your entertainers and you both boast in great pride. The Edomites have long since removed their factories from your lands, and you lack the manufacturing power you once had and even the raw materials to produce what you need to fight your never-ending wars.
For you go from war to war, and you have utterly decimated the lands, both foreign and domestic. For from you, Secret Babylon, has gone forth the scourge of the Red Armies, even spreading world wide the red leaven of the great red Dragon, for you have served the fallen ones secretly since the beginning and continue to this day. Secret Babylon, you willingly give your consent to your Satanic rulers, who know full well their plans and know full well they are in the process of fully destroying your once great nation and you. For you are guilty of the blood of the saints, and the blood of the martyrs cries from the earth for your judgment and if Yahweh were not to judge you he would have to repent to the nations he has taken in judgment in times past, even those who serve as a warning of your own impending judgment that you blatantly ignore.
From you, Secret Babylon, came the destruction brought on foreign lands by the Red Armies as the Edomites ingratiated themselves to the working class with their poisonous leaven, even their blasphemous manifesto financed by the Red Shield. For the robber barons of times past, even your captains of industry of previous generations, (even those to whom you have sold your posterity) are the ones responsible for the scourge of the red armies. Secret Babylon with her web of debt has financed and sponsored the Red Armies in their endeavors from the beginning, and Secret Babylon has been part of their network from the beginning as the Red Shield established itself worldwide. Even the fiery dragon’s breath that has come from the Red Shield, for they are the fallen ones who walk among you.
From secret Babylon were their “revolutionary” leaders trained in secret for she sits on many waters, and they were sent secretly into foreign lands, even into Gog and Magog and their revolutions were great, and violent, and cruel and they now cover the earth. They spread their satanic leaven across the lands of the east and utterly consumed all in their paths. They went forth from Secret Babylon and have been a scourge on the earth, and all the while secret Babylon has lied and the great whore has claimed to speak for me and called herself Christian. This violent overthrow of the old order has gone across the earth and now moves to its final stage, and they will be permitted their system, but only to serve the eternal purposes of Yahweh,

for in truth the fallen ones do tremble and fear grips their vile hearts for they know their long coming judgment is upon them. For you Secret Babylon in your fornication and whoredoms, you sleep with the enemy.
Behold! The great whore, even Secret Babylon a nation of many states, is that woman showed to John the Revelator, even that woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of my Martyrs and your judgment is upon you. For in such manner, you have lived deliciously while your leaders destroyed other nations with your consent and with your money you are as guilty as these Edomite tares you have sold your posterity for the pleasures of sin. You financed and supported and secretly coordinated the overthrow of many nations! And all nations who have been overthrown by the red armies with the backing of the Red Shield have been culled and persecuted and tortured and starved and murdered in the most grievous manner. The saints who were in these lands you have martyred even untold millions. And all the while you danced and used Satans sorceries in celebration thinking it will never come to you, even the drugs given you for your deaths. Secret Babylon, you have sacrificed an entire generation of children who are now military aged men who could have defended you but instead now live on the streets of your disgusting cities and are hopelessly addicted to these sorceries and they have become zombies of the walking dead as these drugs rot their flesh even while they are still alive.
Now comes your judgment in full Secret Babylon and you are a spectacle for all to see, yet you continue in ignorance and blindness saying in your hearts that calamity will never come on you, even though you have cheered as your leaders brought calamity to the shores of countless nations in their unjust wars of which you were entertained as you watched on television. And so you have been divided amongst your enemies and they already enjoy the spoils of war even before the missiles have fallen. For Secret Babylons defeat is guaranteed and given by Yahweh himself and nothing will stop her utter ruin and never again will she rise.
I am calling, I am calling, will you hear me?
I am he who sheds many tears in utter heartbreak for what will come of those who ignore my voice
I am Jesus the Nazarene
I am he whom the eternal God has sent to rescue you before calamity and judgment strikes
I am that great Lord of Lords and King of Kings!
I am coming to save the faithful from wrath for so are the promises of Yahweh in my peace treaty
I am he who is coming for my faithful, called, and chosen, even my Body and my Church and even my Bride
I, Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these words by me servant and by my servant have these words been sent.
Hear my voice my children and heed my call and learn of me and accept my wisdom. Do not despair for the birth pangs are non-stop now, but this judgment is not for you. I am nearer than your next breath and my appearing is here. Suddenly will you find yourselves in Yahweh’s throne room where you will be fully recreated in your Lord, Christ Jesus, and you will forever be like me and will forever be with me and I love you greatly my called, chosen, and faithful. Prepare yourselves to come to your full inheritance that is in my hand, only faint not and watch always and then suddenly I AM!

AUGUST 04, 2024
Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach and bow your ears in obedience. And so the seasons change and the day is here when calamity will fall suddenly on the earth. Suddenly will I gather my faithful to me in the clouds and suddenly will destruction fall across the earth and suddenly will the world you know be forever altered, never to return to this corrupted and sinful state. Though an end of Satan’s sinful rule is in sight, that day will not fully come until all power, and authority of the Dragon is put down at my second coming when I will come to rule the earth in righteousness with the warriors in heaven, even the great armies of heaven amongst whom will be the first-fruits from the dead and I will gather them to myself.
For those who will be with me are called, and chosen, and faithful and true. And they have proven themselves faithful in a few things, so I will make them ruler over much and they do enter into the joy of their Lord. They will be an indestructible and eternal army that in no way can be conquered nor stopped, and they will literally tread underfoot all aspects of the enemies Kingdom in utter destruction and subjection of all things evil. For vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repay. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.
So hear my words and understand the hope of all creation, for even the creation waits in earnest expectation for the manifestation of the Sons of God! For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope: Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. And so I, Jesus Christ, will deliver the creation in righteousness and I will heal the earth and in righteousness will I rule. And I will put down all authority and rule of the enemy, and Satans kingdom will never again rise.
As it is written, so shall it be, and so I had John the Revelator write: And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him is called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it, he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he has on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords. And so is the hope of my second coming, and that day draws ever closer with each passing second.
Behold! On that day I will bring my warriors for so is their inheritance, even an army like no other, for an army such as mine has never been, an unconquerable army composed of the redeemed, even those who were born dead in trespasses and sins but now will live life eternal and who cannot be killed nor conquered. For I am empowered by Yahweh for such a purpose, and I will have empowered and rewarded them for their faithfulness and love for me and my name, even Jesus the Christ! For whoso loves and serves Yeshua HaMashiach also loves and serves Yahweh, for there is no higher than the great everlasting God of Israel! On that approaching day you will see the heavens opened, and you will see me, Jesus Christ, lead out from the heavens that great and mighty heavenly host, and it will be an army like no other, ever! For my Bride

will be with me.
And I will utterly crush the beast and the false prophet and all their armies and all their abominations that they have abominably made and so will they be destroyed even by the brightness of my coming and by that sharp double-edged sword proceeding from my mouth, and they shall not stand but will be utterly destroyed. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into that burning lake of fire and brimstone and never will they be released from their torment, for they have made themselves worthy. But first the earth must be cleansed through Jacob’s trouble and many will come to me, even many multitudes and every soul who calls on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved to the uttermost, and Israel must be gathered for I will yet save a remnant from Jacob who will yet come to their true and everlasting Messiah, for I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I do come according as the promises to the Father’s have been declared of old by Yahweh himself, and I am their fulfillment and my time has come.
So for those who have rejected my saving name, even Jesus the Nazarene, I counsel you to hear my words and understand the times you live and run to the sound of my voice and call on my name right now and confess me as your Lord, because you have no time to waste. Just as there were those who were firstborn into the new birth at the birth of my church on the day of Pentecost as recorded in scripture, so too will there be the last to come to the new birth in this age of grace, even all who come to salvation as my outpouring of holy spirit in my age of grace and mercy comes to a close.
And so a dearth of all things godly will now fall on the earth and sin will now be unrestrained as I remove my restrainer when I gather my Church. Natural man has rejected my voice, natural man has rejected my grace, natural man has rejected my mercy, natural man has rejected my invitation to righteousness, and natural man has rejected me Jesus the Nazarene and therefore natural man has rejected Yahweh the great eternal God who sent me, and now I will give the world the darkness they so desire.
But understand that many will do mighty works for me, and my two witnesses, even my two candlesticks will prophecy, and I will send my 144,000 to rescue many, so fear not! Salvation will be accomplished, even through the destruction of the flesh and great multitudes will come to salvation during this time. For of a truth, Yahweh has never and will never leave himself without witness!
The times of the Gentiles have born much fruit amongst those who would otherwise remain hopeless unless they were included into the promises made to the Fathers, even those who live by the faith of the Son of God who loved them and gave himself for their salvation. For as it is written: The just shall live by faith! And so by faith in me, Christ Jesus, they have become children of faith, even children of the faith of Abraham. For Abraham believed God before the seal of circumcision was given, and it was accounted to him for righteousness, even as Moses testifies! And so Abraham is the father of all who believe and those who have become justified by faith in Jesus Christ the Righteous, for I am the just and justifier of all who believe on my mighty name!
Yet so many have used my grace and mercy as a license to sin, even relishing and boasting of their sinful and destructive ways, even teaching their children to live their sinful ways and so the generations are evil in their ways and their ways are detestable and so evil men and seducers have become worse and worse. Be not deceived, if a man sows to the flesh that man will of the flesh reap corruption. And all who reject my offer of eternal life and instead choose the corruption of Adam will reap the fruit of that same corruption in eternal judgment, for judgment is here and the times of revealing have arrived.

Truly, truly, the times of great judgment prophesied of old by Enoch the scribe (for his testimony was given for this generation), are come upon the earth even as it is written and all will give an account. Those who have accepted my offer of salvation and who are found faithful in Christ at my appearing will be forever changed, whether they have fallen asleep in Christ or whether they are alive and remain in Christ, those in Christ at my appearing will be taken into the heaven of heavens. To be in Christ is to walk by my mighty spirit, even the law of the spirit of life! And those who lived righteously before the birth of my Church and for the tribulation saints is the resurrection of the just, where the righteous will rise to newness of life in great, everlasting and eternal reward. At the end of my 1000 year reign there will be the great white throne judgment and all those who lived and reveled in unrighteousness and sin will be recompensed according to their works and many will fall to the second death for so have they chosen.
And so the times of revealing have come, and the everlasting gospel has been revealed in its time even the little book in the hand of my mighty angel is now revealed and the utterance of the seven thunders have been declared! For this work is an everlasting work, and is the culmination of covenants and promises of old into the covenants and promises of the new, even my New Testament that I have ratified in my own blood. For I Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus Christ the Righteous who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, am he who is given for the fulfillment of all promises and all covenants.
For John the Revelator wrote what he saw, and so he wrote: And I saw another mighty Angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth. And again John the Revelator announced: And I saw another Angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
And so it is written and so it is done. The everlasting gospel has come to be revealed in its time and the little book is no longer a mystery. The mighty angel who is clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. The rainbow is the sign given at the Noahic covenant that Yahweh made with Noah after the deluge that he would never again flood the entire earth. A cloud and pillars of fire represent God’s covenant with Moses, built further on previous covenants. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people and so was the Old Testament ratified!
And as it is written in Hebrews: For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
And so as it is written so has it been accomplished my faithful, and so is the New Testament. And even as it is El Shaddai that commanded the light to shine out of darkness in the beginning, in like manner the

Almighty God has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ. So it is, in my new covenant which is of stronger force, since I ratified it with my sinless blood, is fulfilled all covenants of all time, for I stated at calvary in my dying breath: It is finished. And so the new covenant was ratified by my blood into the New Testament!
And so in me, Christ Jesus, are the covenants of old fulfilled with open face glory, even in the face of your everlasting savior and Messiah, even me Yeshua HaMashiach. And this angel John the Revelator describes had one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth for my salvation is open to both those from the sea of nations, (the Gentiles) and those from the land of promise even all who have made me their everlasting Lord, even as many as the Lord our God shall call! And so my everlasting gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all to whom it is sent and many will come to salvation for every word of God is living and eternal and not one word of Yahweh will in anywise fail nor pass until all be fulfilled. For with Yahweh all promises are yea and amen and all will be fulfilled and I, Christ Jesus, gave myself in agonizing torment to seal my new covenant in my own sinless blood, once and for all and into everlasting eternity will the new testament live.
So hear my words and understand my speech, even the voice of your Lord and Messiah. The times have come my children and my words have saturated the earth and my prophets and ministers have covered the ends of the earth, and in all languages, and tongues, and nations has my gospel of salvation been heard, even to the ends of the earth. And so it is, and so I declare: My good news is built always on the foundation of the law and prophets and I am the chief cornerstone of which the entire temple of the living God rests! My children, you are the temple of the living God!
And so I give you to understand there are many components to the gospel of Christ! Are you foolish enough to believe there are only four gospels? And there are also many other things which I did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. And so it is there is the good news of my first coming, there is the good news of the mystery of God that I revealed to Paul the Apostle, there is the everlasting gospel that leads us to the culmination of all things. With Yahweh there is never an end of good news!
And so I ask you a question? Are you Yahweh’s counselor? Are your lying theologians and lukewarm ministers able to counsel Yahweh? Who are you, oh man, to determine when and how Yahweh speaks and the content and nature of his Words, or to whom he chooses to send his words? And so it is. The Words of God will continue to flow and all testimonies will be completed and books will be written into eternity for the Word of God lives and abides forever!
And so I ask you, did the New Testament of Christ Jesus erase the Old Testament and Old covenants? God forbid! Every Word God is pure and all will be fulfilled even once, all, and forevermore! And so is the nature of the unchanging God! Around his throne are ten thousand times ten thousand yet he needs no counselor. Yahweh, the great eternal God works all things after the counsel of his own will and he is the everlasting God! Yet he has revealed his plans, even his eternal and everlasting will in increments. Why would Yahweh do such a thing you may ask? Have you not read what Paul the Apostle recorded when I had him write? But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God had determined before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the princes of this world have known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

And so the eternal God, even Yahweh who needs no counselor and in his everlasting wisdom reveals his ways and Words in the manner he chooses in the fulfillment of his everlasting plans of redemption for mankind. Understand my loves, even my Bride, that you have been in Yahweh’s heart since before creation and you have been cleverly hid in the Father’s heart and it has been hidden from you what you will become at my appearing, for you are dead and your life is hid in me Christ Jesus. And when I appear, so shall you appear with me in glory! My little ones you are about to be recreated fully in me and you will be astounded at what Yahweh has prepared for those that love him. For as it is no man on earth has fully understood exactly what the sons of God will become at their full redemption, and you are about to find out for the day is here and my appearing is at hand.
I counsel one and I counsel all, even Christ Jesus your eternal Lord! Receive my Words and gain wisdom and understanding, for your true selves are an eternal mystery hid in God himself that is about to be fully revealed. You will very soon find yourself standing in the very throne room of Yahweh, even our Father, and he eagerly awaits and longs for your presence right now, even from eternities past. And the great halls in heaven are prepared for your arrival and the tables are set and the wedding of the Bridegroom to his Bride is at hand and my bride has made herself ready and I will receive them to myself and forevermore will they ever be with me in everlasting covenant and they will do many mighty works of which has not entered into the hearts of men at this time.
And so Yahweh the great eternal and everlasting God has readied and prepared many things for you, and I, Christ Jesus the elevated and ascended Lord have your reward in my hand even for my faithful. And the host of heaven eagerly await your presence and into heavenly and everlasting reward you will now go. So fear not because your lives are now to be revealed and at any second now the last trumpet will sound, are you ready for my appearing my little ones? For it is nearer than you imagine and time between then and now is inconsequential and serves the everlasting purposes of Yahweh the great eternal God!
Do you not know? Or have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord has created the ends of the earth? He neither faints, nor is weary and there is no searching of his understanding
I am he who speak of things that are to come as if though they have happened
I am he who has called you to eternal life and sealed you with the seal of the everlasting God!
I am the chief cornerstone of which the entire building rests
I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I will yet save Jacob!
I am the just and justifier of all who believe on my mighty name!
Behold! I have sent these Words by me servant and by my servant have these words been sent!
Keep yourselves pure my faithful, and don’t allow your hands to get dirty! Continue to wash yourselves in my atoning blood that you may stand before me newly created and pure as a virgin for I have washed you in my atoning blood. Look to the skies! My signs are given worldwide now and they are in the heavens and they are all over the earth and the birth-pangs are non-stop. Your full redemption is here, only stand firm and faithful to the end, for yours is an everlasting end of which eternity await!

Suddenly is Your Hope Revealed!
AUGUST 09, 2024
Gather yourselves and hear the voice of your Lord, even the voice of Jesus the Nazarene for I am he who offered myself once, all, and forevermore as the perfect Passover Lamb to Yahweh for your sins, even the great eternal God, as your high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek so you may have remission of sins. Come to me, and bring your ears and your hearts to listen with full faith to my words of faith! Yes I ask you to listen, and not just hear the sounds of my words but listen with your hearts that you may discern my intent and find comfort in my love for you and that you would receive with meekness the word that is grafted in you, which is able to save your souls.
For I speak to the faithful in my Church, even my body, even my bride even all those whom I am about to gather to myself in the safety of the heavens in the throne room of Yahweh. For I am he who cares for your souls and he who tends to your continued growth that you may grow as a righteous plant before me, for I am he whom Yahweh has given as gardener and caretaker of his most sacred garden of the souls of the redeemed. For you are the pearl of great price and amongst Yahweh’s many treasures you are amongst the priceless of which no stone has been left unturned in your salvation and no effort spared to prune you and succor you and to present you to Yahweh, even your almighty Father as a chaste virgin without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. So fear not, neither allow any doubt regarding the least of my Words!
And so I ask you, my loves, why do your hearts trouble you? Why do you wag your heads as if you carry reproach? Have you allowed the Satans to creep into your hearts and whisper false words of comfort that only issue in unbelief as they seek to tear and rend all that is holy? Will you take to yourselves that ancient serpent in his ever lying craftiness and ever advancing deceitfulness who would slither into your ears the very lying words that would overthrow your faith, as indeed has happened to so many who have allowed their minds to be corrupted from the single-minded focus on me, Christ Jesus your Lord?
For there is no other who will care for you, and all others are pretenders who do pretend and there is no other Jesus but only cheap knock off imitations and worthless counterfeits designed to deceive. So I ask you not to ignore this discernment that I would impart to you so you may continue to stand as a beacon of light even in these last moments before the world you have known ceases to exist and is altered forevermore from its current ungodliness into everlasting judgment that will now fall as everlasting punishment on the ungodly who seek to lay claim to my inheritance. For the earth is mine and the fullness there of, and I am the great eternal Lord of Lords and King of Kings, even your righteous Lord and I am he who will take my inheritance from the hands of the squatters who have no claim and are no kings and are no gods and are no aliens from other worlds but fallen ones who pretend for they are all pretenders who pretend. And their days will be made an everlasting end in their everlasting inheritance in the hottest flames of blue.
For the birth pangs are non-stop now, and there are multitudes of signs above and multitude of signs in the earth that are ever apparent and unceasing. And these are given as an announcement and that you may have hope, so do not discount and rationalize them away in such manner as the scoffers! The handiwork of Yahweh given by the hands of his mighty angels, and indeed drawn by the finger of God himself at times, even at his everlasting command do announce these approaching heavenly events, for the day is here and is

upon you my loves, so fear not! The times are here for the gathering of my faithful to meet me in the clouds as I descend from heaven with the voice of the archangel and the mighty trump of God, so believe my Words for they are yea and amen!
Who and whatever is there that should trouble you my children? Are you afraid that the bridegroom will not arrive and take the hand of his bride in eternal covenant as promised of old? Has the Word of God become of none effect? God Forbid! As it is written and announced so will it surely be that suddenly I will snatch you away from wrath into the safety of the heavens where I have gone to prepare a place for you, for in my Father’s house are many mansions. And so will you ever be with me and so will you be kings and priests before Yahweh the great eternal God, for so has he purposed and prepared in your lives, and who is able to stop the purposes and preparation of the everlasting God?
I tell you of a truth, there is nothing and no one who is able to hinder in the least the purposes of El Shaddai and none can stand (even in the slightest protest) without being silenced in awe at the utter power, splendor and trembling that results when Yahweh even moves the slightest to stand from his eternal throne and all heaven and earth shakes at his mighty presence. For though Yahweh has concealed himself in gentleness, love, and compassion for many days now (for one day is as a thousand years in the sight of the eternal God) now is the time that Yahweh has chosen where he will reveal himself to his creation, when they will all know that there is a God in heaven, and they will surely understand that as it is above, so shall it be below even on the earth for Yahweh is God of both heaven and earth and reigns supreme over his creation and there is none else besides him in might, splendor and power. (And the fallen ones are gripped in everlasting fear) So fear not Children of the Most High for the great eternal God, even Yahweh himself is he who fights for you and he who will rescue, redeem, and transform your very lives into eternal splendor in the twinkling of an eye.
So why do you grow impatient? Do you feel as though your eternal Lord and bridegroom has jilted you, my bride? Has your everlasting savior abandoned his body, leaving it headless? God forbid such a thing should even be considered. Of what thing has Yahweh announced to his creation as being imminent that has not happened thereafter? Did the Words of Noah fall onto dry ground as empty promises when he was a preacher of righteousness for a hundred and twenty years in the world that then was? No! But suddenly and with great violence the waters were unleashed in an instant and rose above the tallest mountains on the earth in the days that followed.
And so I counsel you to not once again join the ranks of those who willingly are ignorant. They willingly choose ignorance to ignore that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved for fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. And so I declare yet again that the day of fire and judgment and perdition of ungodly men is here, just as promised of old, and so shall it suddenly be.
And so I ask you yet again, my little ones, Is God a man that he should lie? Am I, Jesus Christ the righteous, unreliable so that I would forget you and yet give you false hope? Have I forgotten you and instead gone fishing? I ask you my loves did I give my last drop of blood in agony on the cross that I would abandon you when I have promised you exceeding great and precious promises, even promises given by Yahweh himself in his eternal mystery, even the great mystery of God?

God forbid such things should even be considered and so identify the evil thoughts of Satan that he throws at you, and reject and rebuke them and replace such frivolous and evil surmising with holy scripture, even the promises of Yahweh that are yea and amen. But for all times and especially such times as these it is written and so Paul wrote to the Corinthians on my behalf: But I fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, even so your minds should be corrupted from the singleness that is in Christ. And so I counsel you my children, even my dearly beloved and longed for to maintain your single-minded focus on me, and my words, for I am the Word of God made flesh and every Word of God will indeed come to pass, and not one of the least of my Words will fail that have been uttered and inspired by that great eternal Holy Spirit, who is Yahweh, the great eternal God!
And so I counsel you my children, even my dearly beloved and longed for, even you my joy and crown: rest in me and rest in my works and cease from your own. For it is written: There remains therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Labor therefore to enter into my rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. My children labor to cease from your own works and do the works that I give you to accomplish and lean not to your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge me, Christ Jesus your ascended Lord, and you will find rest among rolling green hills of pasture and safety, especially under the care and protection of my mighty arm, for I am Yeshua HaMashiach who is also your chief shepherd who is about to appear!
And so I ask you, my loves, will you return to live amongst the foolish scoffers who mock and seek to tempt you into their faithless ways? Will you ignore my words and even the many signs, miracles and wonders that surround you? Do you foolishly think that you can continue to live as those who are ignorant of impending calamity and judgment? Will you go back to living amongst the walking judged, who refuse repentance and choose instead harsh judgment and punishment? I tell you plainly should you try you will find yourselves as the simple who continue past my warnings and are punished unnecessarily and so you have been warned.
Understand that the world you now live is not the same as it was even a few weeks ago, and it continues to change at an ever-increasing rate. Understand that none of you have ever lived in the world that now is, for the world you now live is chained in judgment and yet is allowed to give off the splendorous announcements of the coming marriage in the heavens where I Christ Jesus will forever wed my faithful bride and so will they ever be with me. And as my bride and my Church are snatched away suddenly, then sudden destruction will fall on all the mockers and evil men who laughed you to scorn saying: Tomorrow will be the same as today, and today is the same as yesterday, and I will see no calamity and I am no widow but am a queen ruling over all things! Except suddenly will their destruction come upon them as a woman in travail, and they shall not escape.
So come out from among them and be ye separate in ALL things and in all of your ways. You can have neither part nor lot with them or you will share in their plagues. Understand that events are already underway, even events that will affect the sinners, but I will provide safety for my faithful that these judgments will not harm you my children. For these non-stop birth pangs are intended to wake the last of those who slumber and to separate the last of those who will board the Ark before calamity falls suddenly and time is up. You can no longer live careless lives and you must walk in great wisdom so heed my warnings and understand that I have given you great wisdom and understanding that you should be able to

discern the times you live, even amongst those who are deep and fast asleep to the approaching calamity and who will suffer as a result.
So understand that the time remaining is inconsequential and only serves Yahweh’s purposes before judgment falls suddenly. Yes, the enemy is given the chance to stage for his attack on Secret Babylon for so is given of him by Yahweh to accomplish. But understand fully that Satan is a defeated enemy who is bound to the earth for judgment and he is only allowed to further the purposes of Yahweh and he will sit in silence and wait for the restrainer to be removed and he can literally do nothing more than he is allowed, so fear not the roar of that toothless lion for the little prince is bound in defeat! For of a truth, the fallen ones fear you and they understand and know that those they once victimized will be the ones who bring judgment and righteous punishment into their own bosoms eternally and forevermore. What? Know you not that you will judge angels?
And so I ask you my loves, will you now disallow my grace and mercy that is extended to the lost, even as judgment and calamity are arranged to fall suddenly? Have you forgotten the many years of grace and mercy that I undeservedly gave to you so you could fulfill your sins before turning to righteousness? Will you deny those who seek to board the Ark so we could be united a moment earlier? I am persuaded better of you, my children, and so I ask your patience and long-suffering, even before calamity falls suddenly.
If any among you think you have cause to bring justice on Satan and his kingdom, I have more cause than has ever entered your hearts. For which of you have fought Satan, even to your last drop of blood as you willingly hung from that rugged stake in utter agony. For I willingly carried my cross and gave myself in eternal victory as I was wronged at the hands of evildoers, as I took your place in judgment in great agony outside the gates among the vilest of sinners. My blood was innocent and no evil could rightfully be charged to my account. Yet in my love for my Father and my love for you, I willingly laid down my life and I would do it again in an instant, though such a thing is not needed. So even in your present distress follow my example of endurance knowing that suddenly you will go into everlasting deliverance!
And so I ask you to continue steadfast right up until the end, even the end where you are suddenly taken in the twinkling of an eye into the heavens into eternal reward and eternal purpose, and yet the dead in Christ shall rise first and you will join them suddenly in everlasting celebration. For the eternal purposes of which you have been called, chosen, sealed, and kept will fulfill the eternal purposes of the most high God and all is about to be revealed in you my children, so shine for me as my lights right now in this last pause before sudden calamity strikes the earth. And I will bring them to you that you may bring them to me, for you are still my ambassadors right up until suddenly you are taken into the heavens. And suddenly will great calamity fall.
Understand that time is up and nothing can turn back the events that are coming and are lining themselves up against the dwellers of the earth, for great is the coming judgment of sinners. And so I ask and constrain you by the very same compassion, grace and mercy Yahweh has shown you in the face of Jesus Christ for your salvation. Can you remain faithful to the end? Will you allow yourselves to enter into my eternal rest without quitting at the last minute? Will you focus your full heart and attention on my words and understand that suddenly it will forever change and suddenly is now.
There is no time remaining for Secret Babylon to repent and there is no more time in my age of grace and mercy for time is up. And to every season there is a time and a purpose and in the consummation of

times will sudden redemption fall on the redeemed so let the redeemed of the earth say so whom he has ransomed from the hand of the enemy. And do not allow the thief to steal your joy for what bride mourns the day of her wedding, even a glorious, holy wedding day of which none can corrupt nor trouble.
So take comfort in my Words of comfort and quit living as those who are cast down in shame and guilt. For you my bride, are those whom I have made spotless and without fault before the very throne of Yahweh, and you are the first-fruits from the dead. Even though those of you who are alive and remain will never taste death, you were born dead in trespasses and sins. And you will have passed directly from death (of which in dying you would have died), straight into life eternal of which you already live the down payment, even that great seal of Yahweh wherewith you are sealed for that sudden day of redemption. For you are born again of incorruptible seed and you are the sons of the most High God, even sons of the Almighty God!
Therefore, take comfort and be at rest and work with me in this victory lap of the ages. For there has never been a time on the earth such as this and never will there be a time such as this again. Even a time where the eternal sons of God consciously await their first breath of eternal life as babes of eternity into the everlasting presence of the everlasting God where they will marry their everlasting Lord in everlasting covenant, and... suddenly, shall it be!
I am he who offered myself once, all, and forevermore as the perfect Passover Lamb
I am about to gather the faithful to myself in the safety of the heavens in the throne room of Yahweh
I am he who cares for your souls and he who tends to your continued growth that you may grow as a righteous plant
I am he whom Yahweh has given as gardener and caretaker of his most sacred garden of the souls of the redeemed
I am the great eternal Lord of Lords and King of Kings, even your righteous Lord
I am he who will take my inheritance from the hands of the squatters who have no claim
I am the Word of God made flesh and every Word of God will indeed come to pass
I am Yeshua HaMashiach who is also your chief shepherd who is about to appear!
I, Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent!
And so I encourage you my loves to faint not and remain steadfast until the very sudden end that will forever make an end of your time on earth in your current state. Suddenly, and in the twinkling of an eye will you find yourselves standing in the throne room of Yahweh in everlasting joy and you will fully understand and know even as you are fully understood and known. And so promise will meet fulfillment in everlasting joy and everlasting glory that awaits you and all will be fulfilled in you in the twinkling of an eye, and suddenly shall it be. Remain in me my children for I love you greatly and am not ashamed to call you my brethren.

The Fulfillment of All Things!
AUGUST 11, 2024
Hear the Words of your living Lord and Savior, even your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach. Understand and listen to my Words my children for I will now speak regarding the fulfillment of all things, for their fulfillment is at hand. So understand, because mankind has now rejected Yahweh’s peace treaty and rejected Jesus the Nazarene (for I am your peace treaty) the seasons on earth will now change from grace to judgment, will now change from mercy to calamity, will now change from peace to war, will now change from gentleness to wrath, will now change to all out vengeance and utter destruction for those who dwell on the earth. Even all those who have refused to make me Lord and accept my love and forgiveness for them, whereby I would have restored them to their creator and given them life eternal, never to die again.
But instead of natural man coming to me fully, many have refused in rebellious arrogance choosing instead to remain with the Satans and their rebellion and have by default joined them either in ignorance, or knowing full well their choice. And so those who have so foolishly chosen will now be subject to the wrath of God and the wrath of the lamb that is so soon to be poured out in full. And even though many have at this time refused, a multitude of multitudes will come to me and confess Jesus as Lord and will call on the name of their Messiah until the end. And so by virtue of Yeshua HaMashiach will they yet be saved. Yet many more will perish, even all those whose names were never written in the Book of Life slain from the foundations of the world and so will be their choice.
And so in the same manner as these changes are happening on earth in judgment, peace has settled over the heavens and war will now utterly consume the earth. There was war in heaven and the accuser of the brethren is cast down, is cast down, and that great red dragon is now bound to the earth and is awaiting his judgment and his judgment lingers not. In utter defeat will he serve his purposes in Yahweh’s eternal plans, for even his enemies obey his voice, and so is given him only in a very limited manner and his kingdom will be utterly destroyed. Behold! That old serpent, even that great red dragon, is now cast down to the earth, and he has great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time! And so I, Yeshua HaMashiach do counsel one and all to run towards the sound of my voice and call on my mighty name to the end for those who love not their lives to the end will awaken to eternal splendor, joy, and reward and great is their reward! For all who call on my name to the end will be saved, in whatever language they call and I Jesus Christ, who am also Yeshua HaMashiach, declare these words!
And so covenants and promises of old will be fulfilled, even all covenants for all time for so is the everlasting gospel. And as war settles over the earth, peace is now established in the heavens where the heavens are now prepared to receive the faithful in Christ, even those who have died faithful in Christ, and those who are alive and remain and live their lives in Christ. For all who walk by the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus in my age of grace will be gathered and receive their eternal reward and will understand and will be set in their orders to fulfill Yahweh’s eternal purpose for which they are created newly in Christ. And so the wedding of the Bridegroom to the Bride will now take place, and there will be great celebration in the heavens in eternal splendor and glory!

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

For from the beginning, God created Adam, and from Adam he created Eve so she would be his eternal companion and to be the mother of all the living and that they would be fruitful and multiply. They were commanded that of all the trees in the garden of Eden, they may freely eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And so with the crafty temptation of the serpent Eve was deceived, and she took of the forbidden fruit and did eat, and she gave to her husband Adam, and he knowingly ate and thus sin corrupted mankind and in dying they have died ever since. And so Adam and Eve never fulfilled their high calling to rule and subdue the earth in righteousness and to be fruitful and multiply and to cover the earth in righteousness but instead sinned and lived the wages of sin until those wages culminated in their deaths and in dying mankind has died ever since. And in the resurrection of the just will they receive their reward and recompense for they were faithful to the end.
And so it is that Yahweh, in his eternal foreknowledge, knew before it happened that mankind would choose sin and death for himself from the beginning. And El Shaddai, even in his great love wherewith he loves mankind, (and all his creation), provided unfathomable grace and mercy when he declared that he would put enmity between Satans seed and the seed of the woman. Satans seed did bruise my heel at Calvary in fulfillment of Yahweh’s Words and I will now move to utterly crush the head of the serpent for so is his future and all who follow, and as it has been written, so it will continue to be done to completion.
Yet, God has chosen in his infinite wisdom to reveal his plans of grace, mercy, and peace for mankind’s full redemption in increments, and yet has always given great hope for the righteous that one day soon they would be raised to newness of life from the dead never to die again, and they would live in plenteousness and peace all the days of their lives and of which days there shall be no end. Over the ages the faithful have died with full faith in Yahweh to fulfill his promises and they have died trusting Yahweh’s covenants as their hope of salvation and all of Yahweh’s covenants will be fully fulfilled in the face of Christ Jesus, even me, your risen Lord and Savior. And so they believed God and to them it was accounted for righteousness even for all those who believed and had hope in the promised seed of the woman.
And so Yahweh’s plan of the ages for mankind’s full redemption has always centered on me, Christ Jesus even Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach for I am the ascended Lord of Lords who is the lamb of God and who has brought eternal salvation to Judean and Gentile alike, and I will yet save Jacob from those who have invaded the land of promise and their destruction lingers not. I am he in whom the lion will lie down with the lamb for in me the lion of the tribe of Judah and the lamb of God will come to full completion. For I am the lion of the tribe of Judah and I am the Lamb of God for I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords and I am the High Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
And so Adam and Eve lived faithfully going forward before the Lord their God, and they were fruitful and did multiply, yet Satan would engineer yet another attack with the rebellion of the fallen watchers. They joined the Satans rebellion and to satisfy their own lusts left the eternal glory of their first estate, of which they were created, to defile themselves with women, even with flesh and blood, for they would have remained in eternal splendor but instead chose their own eternal punishment in order to fulfill their lusts at the expense and death of the creation that then was.
And so these fallen angels taught fallen man how to destroy himself through the lineage of Cain and through the forbidden knowledge and manipulations they taught mankind. They posed as gods and demanded worship and TOOK to themselves wives by force from all they chose, and many women

volunteered themselves at the direction of the Satans in order to tempt and entice the watchers into their lustful sins of which they bound themselves eternally to their own curse for they made amongst themselves mutual imprecations. This happened in the days of Jared and their abominations, even their Nephilim spread over the earth in their worldwide empire during their so-called golden age.
And the watchers and their seed did corrupt the earth and all that was therein and strange genetic mutations of all sorts were made and abounded in the earth for they sinned against all flesh and their lusts knew no bounds, and they pretended to be gods, even gods who create but in reality they are nothing but pretenders who partook in gross cross-breeding between species. And so the earth became utterly corrupt and was ruled by Nephilim, who consumed men and the acquisitions of men. And all that were left undefiled at the time of Noah (for Noah was just and upright and walked with Yahweh and found favor in Yahweh’s sight) were eight souls saved alive with the animals Yahweh brought to the Ark for their species salvation. And so God flooded the earth and all corruption from the world that then was perished, and the watchers have no peace, nor forgiveness and eternally and forevermore will their harsh judgment be for they are worthy. And not the watchers only, but all who join themselves to the Satans rebellion will suffer in such manner and be recompensed eternally in that great lake of fiery blue brimstone that burns the hottest and purest flames of punishment.
After the flood, God established the world that now is, even established at the first in righteousness. And Yahweh entered into covenant with Noah, where Yahweh invited Noah to raise up righteousness on the earth and be fruitful and multiply that the promised seed of the woman may come. Yahweh promised never to flood the earth again and in spite of mankind’s evil nature, God worked with mankind to protect and bless the righteous bloodlines on earth of which I Yeshua HaMashiach arose.
God blessed them to be fruitful and multiply and to replenish the earth, and God promised both man and beast that he would never again destroy all flesh from the earth by water and never again would El Shaddai flood the entire earth but would preserve the earth, and preserve mankind and his seed, and this same world is preserved from that day of covenant where the Father of Lights set his bow in the heavens as a token and reminder of his covenant with Noah. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
And so Yahweh raised up Abram to become Abraham, and he promised Abram that his name would no longer be Abram but Abraham and that he would make him a Father of many nations and that he would give to Abraham and to his seed the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and that Yahweh would be their God! And so Abraham became a Father of many nations, of which Yahweh promised in covenant. Now, to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ. And so the just shall live by faith!
And so the children fell into bondage in Egypt after the children of promise went there under Joseph’s protection and sustenance for Joseph ruled righteously under Pharaoh who was greater than Joseph in the throne, but Joseph served the great I AM! There arose a pharaoh who knew not Joseph, and these tares suppressed and endeavored to kill the Christ line yet once again, even the children of promise. And Yahweh raised up a Hebrew deliverer from the house of Pharaoh, even he who was drawn out of the water

and saved alive by Yahweh’s grace. It was Moses himself who would lead the children of promise out of bondage into the glorious liberty of the land of promise, for they are the children of promise and I will yet raise them from their sleep and reward the faithful and righteous richly, even those who stayed faithful to the end. And so Moses delivered the children of Israel from the hand of their oppressors and all who pursued them drowned in the sea, for who is able to stand against El Shaddai?
And so Yahweh led Moses and the children of promise to Mount Sinai where Yahweh gave precepts, commandments and ordinances contained in laws to Moses for obedience of all the children. And blessings and curses were established for obedience and for disobedience. And when Yahweh had given in covenant to Moses the commandments contained in ordinances for obedience, Moses then ratified the covenant into a Testament by the shedding of blood. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the Altar. And he took the book of the covenant, and read to the audience of the people: and they said, All that the Lord has said, will we do, and be obedient. And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all these words. Moreover, he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle, and all the vessels of the Ministry. And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood: and without shedding of blood is no remission of sins.
And so history unfolded as written, and in time the nation of Israel was fully established, yet there still was no dwelling for Yahweh among the people. And Yahweh raised up a righteous King, even a man after God’s own heart! In the course of time Yahweh sent Nathan the Prophet to David and told him that when your days are fulfilled, and you will sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. And your house and your kingdom will be established forever before you: your throne will be established forever. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
And so mankind has followed Yahweh from covenant to covenant adding onto covenant which was ratified by the sacrifice of animals and covenant was added to testament. Yet, for mankind’s best efforts he of his own ability could never live up to the righteousness of God, even that just and righteous law of Moses of which I love and fulfilled. Should any call the law of Moses and the many covenants of Yahweh accursed, let him be accursed. For the law is good and just and holy and all the promises of Yahweh are yea and amen. Yet, the law was given as a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ. For I, Jesus the Nazarene am who Yahweh has given to fulfill that which mankind is incapable due to the sin passed on from generation to generation from the blood of Adam, which is corrupted evermore. For what the law could not do in as much as it was weak because of the flesh: that performed God, and sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh.
So in the fullness of times I, Jesus the Nazarene, was born of a woman according to the requirements of Mosaic law and in fulfillment of covenants, and I am the promised seed of the woman foretold by Yahweh himself these many ages ago. For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten son, that whoso believes on him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And so I am the only begotten son of God, even that seed of promise of which the prophets have prophesied of old until now. And I am he who is set for the fulfillment of all things and in me, Christ Jesus, will all things and all promises come to fulfillment and not one promise will be left undone, but all will be fulfilled for all time.

For it is written in Hebrews where I had Paul write: For if the blood of Bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called, might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
So understand that in me, Christ Jesus are the promises of old kept and the covenants of old kept and the testament of old is kept and fulfilled for I am their perfect fulfillment. And yet there are still promises to be fulfilled and now are the times of fulfillment. For so are the times, where I will suddenly raise from sleep those who have fallen asleep in Christ, and I will suddenly gather those who are alive and remain to meet me in the clouds and suddenly will we be united in the throne room of Yahweh himself. For you my Church and even my bride are also the fulfillment of conventional promise and you are born again of incorruptible seed and redeemed by the many promises in my New Testament, which is a new covenant that embodies every promise of covenants of old and even adds exceeding great and precious promises whereby you are redeemed to everlasting life and everlasting reward and forever will we be together.
Understand that the lives you have lived in the flesh, even you my faithful and chosen, those lives are at an end at your full redemption. Understand that you are fully identified with me, Christ Jesus, on every level. When I was crucified for your sins, you were also crucified with me. When I died on that rugged stake, you also died with me. When I was raised to life after three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so to were you raised to newness of life, and when I was ascended to the heaven of the heavens so to were you ascended with me and so you are seated in the heavenlies. For I am your perfect Passover, and I am your substitute who took your place in judgment and deserved punishment. And I, Jesus the Nazarene, willingly redeemed you from the curse of the law because of your sinful flesh you are never able to fulfill the law of your own efforts.
Understand that I did not come to destroy the law, nor covenants, but to fulfill all in the times of fulfillment. Should any call the law of Moses and the many covenants of Yahweh accursed, let him be accursed. For the law is good and just and holy, and all the promises of Yahweh are yea and amen. Yet, the law was given as a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ. For I, Jesus the Nazarene, am who Yahweh has given to fulfill that which mankind is incapable due to the sin passed on from generation to generation from the blood of Adam, which is corrupted evermore. For what the law could not do in as much as it was weak because of the flesh: that performed God, and sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh.
Every promise is about to be fully realized and fulfilled in me Christ Jesus and I will enter marriage covenant with my Bride that together they will rule with me in my inheritance and they will, by my lead and with me, heal the earth and go forth and rule as priests and kings in the earth and every covenant will be fulfilled from Adam to Moses in the Face of Jesus Christ. These are the promises of eternal life that will be fulfilled in the righteous, even all those who become recreated as one new man in Christ Jesus. For all will be recreated fully and rewarded eternally for their portion and all shall be yea and amen. For every yod, and every thorn of a yod will be fulfilled utterly and for all time.
Understand that you are the temple of the living God, my faithful Church and I have created you as a house made without hands so that you may be an eternal dwelling place of the everlasting God, even of Yahweh

your Father. And I will wed my bride and will forever be with them in eternal covenant, that where I am, so to will they be, and forevermore will they be like me, Christ Jesus their eternal Lord. And understand my faithful that the times of separation are at a close and there will be no more separation between Yahweh and his beloved sons and there will be no more separation between Christ Jesus your eternal Lord and those whom I dearly love. Understand that we will move as one man and there will be no sin nor hindrance. You will do many mighty works that have not even entered into the hearts of men. You will be my mighty kings and priests of which I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords and we will rule the earth in righteousness.
And many more will be raised to life at the conclusion of Daniels seventieth week and they will all be rewarded according as their faithfulness has been. And all who have died faithful in expectation that their Lord and Messiah would not leave their souls in the grave will awaken to newness of life and eternal restoration. For I will connect them with their loved ones and I will restore to them what the locusts have eaten and I will restore to them what Satan stole from them during the times they were strangers on the earth awaiting their full redemption from this fallen and evil world.
And so is the everlasting gospel and evermore will all things be fulfilled in righteousness, holiness, and truth. For nothing will enter the gates of my kingdom that is defiled or evil or that loves and makes lies but in truth and everlasting righteousness will my rule be. So hear the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach even all to whom these words are sent. Your everlasting Lord has not forgotten the promises of Old nor have any testaments come to nothing. But all will be fulfilled and indeed, much has already been fulfilled so look to those things for hope. For as it is written so shall it be done and so is the everlasting gospel in these times of fulfillment.
I Yeshua HaMashiach have sent these Words by my servant and by me servant have these words been sent.

I am the promised seed of the woman
I am your peace treaty
I am the ascended Lord of Lords who is the lamb of God
I am he in whom the lion will lie down with the lamb
I am the lion of the tribe of Judah
I am the Lamb of God
I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords
I am the High Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
So I give you to understand that the fulfillment of all things is here and is already underway. Those of my bride and body will serve and live newness of life alongside those who will be resurrected in righteousness at the resurrection of the just after Daniel’s seventieth week. And in righteousness and peace will we live in harmony with God’s creation and there will be an enduring and everlasting peace for the children of promise, and they shall serve one another, and they shall serve me, and they shall serve Yahweh and in peace and harmony will Yahweh’s creation be restored.

For there yet remains a rest to God’s people. And so as my age of grace comes to a close the final age is nearly here my children, even that last day when we will all rest from our labors and troubles, and we will enjoy the fat of the land as we rest in the day of rest even a Sabbath day of harmony will there be. There have been six days of labor, for one day is with the Lord as a thousand year and a thousand years as a day. Thus, in my thousand-year reign will the faithful spend a day of rest with their creator, Father, and Everlasting God before Yahweh creates a new heaven and a new earth wherein will only ever dwell everlasting righteousness. Behold, the times are now, so be ready!

Babylon the Great Is Fallen, Is Fallen!
AUGUST 18, 2024
Incline your hearts to my words and hear my speech, and allow my words to penetrate your hearts: for even the faithful amongst my Church and even my Bride face temptations of rationalization and unbelief. Hear me and hear me well and lend your ears to understand the times you live, for none of you have ever lived the current events lining up against the world in judgment. For judgment and calamity are here and already underway, though these are just the birth pangs, which are non-stop now and are intended to warn those who live unawares. Yet, even amongst my elect and faithful are those who would willingly choose blindness over reality and willingly choose to hear static instead of the clear instruction and comfort the Words of the Lord bring.
For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus Christ in the English tongue, am he who sends these words by my servant whom I have raised and commissioned and hidden in my quiver for such a time as this. And no marvel for so are my ways, for I Christ Jesus, am he who is able to raise apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers from the masses having no credentials of this fallen world nor are they of those who have aligned themselves in ecumenical agreement with Satan’s own ministers who appear as ministers of righteousness. And no marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light, therefore it is no great thing that his ministers transform themselves as though they were ministers of righteousness, for surely they seek to unite all under their ecumenical one world banner.
And as my friend John the Baptist said these many jubilees ago as he made straight the paths that I would walk: Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is chopped down, and cast into the fire.
Read and understand and ask for wisdom, my little ones, and apply these words to your times. For I say plainly to you that I have not sent the mighty of this world as my messengers and prophets, nor do I require worldly credentials, Dr this and Reverend that, even titles men give themselves to appear godly. For fallen man ever seeks to glorify his flesh in worldly accomplishments, even seeking to stand righteous before God himself in corrupted flesh of which no man can purify, except through me Jesus the Nazarene. And so I ask what worldly credentials did I carry during my ministry to Judea, when I was sent not but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel? Was it not a stumbling block to the unbelieving amongst my countrymen when they asked from where comes this wisdom and great works to this man? Is not this the carpenter’s son?
And as it is written so is it accomplished: But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence. So hear my Words of faith that are spoken on the lips of my faithful and I have said before, and now say again that my prophets, which are many, do not contradict holy scripture, nor do they contradict me, Christ Jesus the Ascended Lord!
Understand, oh you of little faith, that my prophets speak in unison, and they speak the Words that I give them. Do you not know the voice of your Lord? Are my Words foreign to you, my little ones? Are you afraid

271

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE

The BITTER SWEET

of the truth? For I am the Word of God made flesh who dwells amongst you and I am he who has given of my mighty spirit that I have poured out on all flesh in these last times as promised. For it is written: your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.
So hear my words and accept my Words for they are truth and all will be fulfilled, even every yod and every thorn of a yod shall come to pass for every Word of God is given for obedience and every Word of God will be fulfilled perfectly with nothing lacking, for Yahweh’s ways are complete and whatever he sets his hand to accomplish produces astounding perfection. Do you not know the ways of your Father, my little ones?
So hear my voice, my called faithful and chosen, even my Church and even my Bride! Will you continue to ignore my words and turn away from my voice in favor of the lies of the world? Will you follow the voice of the fallen ones as you spend you lives mindlessly staring at a screen? I beg you, hear my voice and I say to you, why do your hearts trouble you? Do you not understand that I am he who sits with billow in hand stoking the flames of purification that I may remove the dross from the precious metals amongst Yahweh’s many priceless treasures?
And so does the works of my hands produce in your hearts and lives my loves: for I am he who removes the unbelief, I am he who removes your faithless ways, I am he who fully purifies you of all manner of fleshly corruption and evil as you come to me and confess your sins and faults that I may yet purify you fully in my atoning blood that you may stand blameless before the throne of Yahweh when I shall present you fully to my Father in person in your very immediate future.
Yet, so many of you seek to return to your lives of old when I haven’t performed Yahweh’s will according to your timing and expectations. For so it is, even my closest disciples and apostles returned to fishing after my crucifixion and resurrection, and yet I made them fishers of men. And so I come to gather you once again to the sound of my voice, and you truly do not understand the dangers that surround you in this present evil world. And so I call you to myself in these last times that you would come fully to me and come fully out of sin and unbelief, for I am he who has called you to virtue and truth, though so many of you still prefer to return to Egypt.
And so I counsel you to take the lessons to heart recorded of old that give warning and wisdom to the wise. For they said to Moses: Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore have you dealt in such manner with us, to carry us away out of Egypt? Why do you still yearn for the days of old? Are you yet enchanted to live the pleasures of sin? Why do you seek to remain amongst the unwise virgins when I am standing over you offering you a hand back on your feet, for you have fallen unawares and are in the dust of the earth, for dust shall be the serpents’ meat. So arise you who sleeps and shake off the dust of the earth and rise in heavenly splendor and have faith in my words of faith that the faithful have spoken on lips of faith!
And so understand what is currently underway and understand the times you live, for many have allowed themselves to be lulled to sleep and have believed the faithless words of Satan as he whispers sweet sounding lies that would deceive the very elect should they choose to believe his lies. Understand that

The BITTER SWEET

Satan, even the devil who deceives the entire world, is now cast down out of the heavens and is bound to the earth for impending judgment that lingers not.
And so there is a pause where the fallen ones are allowed to move their pieces into place on the worlds’ chess board, and a pause where the last remaining souls are now boarding the Ark of eternal life in me Christ Jesus their risen Lord and Savior. Yet, so many of you in your faithless reasoning conclude my Words as false and foolishly conclude that you have time to return to your old lives of sin and pleasure. Except, suddenly, will the faithful be taken in refuge to the throne room of Yahweh himself in great reward and eternal splendor and eternal inheritance, and the faithful will all be changed forevermore.
Will you remain amongst the faithful? Do you have the humility to recognize your own unfaithfulness and repent so you may join the ranks of the faithful? Should you choose to see, I Christ Jesus, will show you. So why do you grow weary in well doing? Have you decided that those whom I bring you to and those whom I bring to you are unworthy of eternal life? And so I counsel you to show the same mercy and grace to your fellow man that I have showed to you in this final pause before destruction descends. And in so doing you will save many, for you are still my ambassadors. So open your mouths in faith, doubting nothing, and I will inspire within you the words to speak.
And so my little ones and even my faithful grow restless and impatient, even in this final pause before my Church and Bride are taken into the heavens. Yet, as it was in the wilderness when Moses met Yahweh on Sinai that the children rose up to eat and to drink and to play, and they made to themselves a golden calf to worship in place of the living God, of whose presence they were not allowed but stood near and saw the glory of the presence of the great eternal God on Sinai! And in like manner as Moses interceded for the children, so I also intercede for all who are heirs of eternal salvation, that all who are called may come fully to salvation and repentance from their evil and faithless ways. Return to my voice and remain in the havens I have given you, and I will protect you from judgment that is not for you. Have I not told you to come out from amongst them and be separate? Obey my voice!
And so judgment now falls on the earth and judgment has been prepared of old for the unbelieving and stiff-necked, even those who willingly or ignorantly cling to Satan’s rebellion. For many, many, many people will willingly choose the flames that are intended for the devil and his angels instead of departing from sin and coming to eternal life by calling on Jesus the Nazarene for their salvation. And so it will be, for El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, has given freewill to mankind that mankind may choose either to live righteously and in peace before Yahweh, or choose eternal destruction in that great lake of fiery blue made for the fallen ones where their worm dies not. And the times of judgment are now.
So I tell all who will hear of events that will happen before they happen. These events are not secret but have been heralded by my prophets and servants for many years now, even all those whom I have sent to Secret Babylon. For the times of Judgment of that great whore are here, and the beast who carries her will now destroy her utterly. For God has put it into the hearts of the ten horns to fulfill his will, and they hate the whore, and will continue to make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and continue to burn her with fire. And so will secret Babylon be made utterly desolate and laid bare in shame for all to see.
Her once great cites that were examples of hard work and production and the abundance of El Shaddai now sit in ruins with her posterity addicted to drugs and living in filth on her disgusting streets. And she is made naked as her defenses are off shored even further and her wealth and strength is given into the

273

THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

hands of her Edomite enemies who pretend they are allies. The great whore who made war with all nations she was sent to conquer is now bound, and defenseless and ready to be fully conquered. And all flesh will be consumed in misery and all who are captured will be culled and those who are able to serve the beast’s purposes will be carried away into slavery and the rest will be killed, though a remnant will survive. And she is ablaze and there are many fires already in her borders and in the lands of her neighbors to the north who share in her plagues. And yet these are just the birth pangs and are not the final judgments but a warning to all of their impending destruction.
For suddenly will it happen, and suddenly will it occur. It will occur only and even as I snatch my faithful from the earth to safety and I will suddenly gather Yahweh’s wheat into his everlasting barn, for the times of harvest are here. Yet not the final harvest, but the first of several, and so judgment begins at the house of God.
Secret Babylon, your times have come, and your days are at an end. I, Jesus the Nazarene, have shed countless tears over your impending destruction and I have sent signs above, and wonders in the skies, and signs in the earth and even many sudden cataclysms occur in real time and in her midst and still Secret Babylon stops her ears in stubborn rebellion, and now she will fully eat of her rebellious ways. So understand, that as I suddenly gather the faithful to safety and reward, so too will sudden destruction fall on mystery Babylon as the restrainer is fully removed. Hear my words and understand my voice because the restrainer is the only thing keeping the destructive lusts of the fallen ones restrained until he who restrains no longer restrains and is taken from the midst.
Then shall sudden destruction come upon the entire world. The battle lines are drawn, and they have prepared for their third world war, even their war to fully overturn the ways of old and the orders of old. And so fire will fall suddenly on Secret Babylon and her cities will be destroyed. Fire will fall suddenly as the missiles crash across her lands, leaving her burnt and naked. Yet many of her cities along her sinful coasts will fall to the waters that will come suddenly and will crash on her shores flooding inland for many, many miles and this will happen from the east and from the west. The earth will suddenly quake uncontrollably, and great destruction will come on the lands of secret Babylon, and the lands will be disfigured and altered. Her bridges will fall, and her roads will become impassable, and a wilderness and a wasteland will remain. The stench of death will cover her lands and pestilence and disease will fill her lands and utterly helpless will she be.
And as this final attack takes place, the hordes of the Red Army will be fully unleashed on the remaining inhabitants of the land. They will kill all who resist and will kill many who do not resist. For the people of secret Babylon are sold into slavery by the mountainous debts she has incurred, for by usury the fallen ones work to destroy the masses. And in so much as her people have pledged and signed their lives away for material gain and the pleasures of sin, so too will those whom they choose to enslave serve those they are indebted in forced labor and the mark will be enforced for all who survive, only take not the mark.
And so the world that now is, will be suddenly replaced with the ashes of ruins and smoldering remains of a once vibrant society. And so famine will descend on the lands, for Secret Babylon has caused famine on many lands and now famine will be her dinner guest, for so she has given and so doubly she will now receive. Water will be a sought after commodity, and many waters will be made bitter from the destruction and fires of war and from the plagues of the unburied that will pollute the land. And many will needlessly

THE

The BITTER SWEET

suffer and perish in judgment for their sins, when such a thing was not necessary for them but those who remain amongst the judged will themselves be judged, yet any and all who call on the name of their Lord until the end shall be saved, but they will have to endure until their last breath. For faithfulness to the end has always been a requirement for the faithful, even Yahweh’s very own children of Abraham who are the children of promise, for the just shall live by faith.
And so will secret Babylon be utterly split along the middle and the waters will rush where there was once fertile dry land, even the heart lands will be flooded up the center. And so God’s mercy and grace will be utterly removed from the earth when the restrainer is suddenly removed and destruction will marry destruction, for these are the times of destruction where Satan’s kingdom will be fully judged and fully destroyed, but first they will serve Yahweh’s purposes in utterly consuming mystery Babylon and so will she be utterly burnt and consumed in many raging fires that will engulf and begin to cleanse the land. And so Secret Babylon’s destruction will come to pass in one hour, for as it is written so shall it be done, and she will receive a double portion of judgment. And as it is written, so shall it be done.
For it is written of old by John the Revelator: I saw another Angel come down from heaven, having great power, so that the earth was lightened with his glory, And he cried out mightily with a loud voice, saying, It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that great city, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of all foul spirits, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are grown rich of the abundance of her pleasures.
And I heard another voice from heaven say, come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues. For her sins are come up into heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. Reward her, even as she has rewarded you, and give her double according to her works: and in the cup that she has filled for you, fill hers double. In as much as she glorified herself, and lived in pleasure, so much give you to her torment and sorrow: for she says in her heart, I sit being a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning. Therefore, shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for God which condemns her, is a strong Lord!
And so this once great nation of states and many cites will fall suddenly, and the angel of destruction currently hovers over her greatest and largest city on the eastern waters and her pride and joy and envy of the world will be utterly destroyed never to rise again. And so too will her destruction be shared by all those who have joined her, for she is that great whore who sits on many waters that are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
For their judgment lingers not, and all the kings of the earth have joined the ten horns in their surprise attack. For their leaders willingly serve the fallen ones, for so are all worldly rulers. There are none good, no, not one. These leaders have worked for many years to bring this attack to pass and have betrayed their own nations of which they were sent to deceive. And the people who willingly followed them in pleasure will fall to the fires of war, pestilence, death and destruction. And these things are at the ready to be suddenly released fully on the earth. And so all so-called Christian nations will fall by the sword as judgment begins at the house of God. And as it was in the days of old when Israel left the Father of Lights and served other gods, who by nature are no gods, so too will these be given into the hands of their enemies, even as the twelve tribes were divided and conquered of old for their betrayal of covenants and brought about by the

curse of the law for the disobedient and hard-hearted.
And from the ashes of total war and destruction will the final beast system arise, for the dragon already prepares the beast system to rise, even those who join the ten kings who will give their full power to the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth who is their false prophet and false Moshiach. The beast from the sea will rise as their Mahdi, and to him, it is given power to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And so the beast from the earth shares the same power as the beast from the sea, and it is he that is the Little Horn prophesied of old by Daniel.
And so these two beasts will be fully empowered by that great red dragon and will rise fully and will conquer and go forth to conquer, and they will say: Who is like the beast? And who is able to make war with the beast? And so all will be required to take their mark who would join them in their satanic society. And madness will fully cover the earth, as the restrainer will no longer be present to convict mankind of sin and to restrain his passions and evil lusts. And so full, unrestrained evil is set to be unleashed on the earth and the abyss will be fully opened, for the dwellers on earth have rejected Yahweh, because they have rejected me, Jesus the Nazarene who is sent for their salvation. But they have counted themselves unworthy of eternal life and rejected Yahweh when Yahweh came to them in love, gentleness, grace, and mercy and offered an everlasting peace treaty to mankind. A peace treaty they have now rejected. Yet, whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved.
And even though times of judgment, great destruction, war, famine, pestilence and the like will be fully unleashed on the earth, this final week even Daniel’s seventieth week is given for Jacob's salvation and I, Yeshua HaMashiach will yet save a remnant from Israel who will accept me as their true and rightful Messiah for, so I am created, made, and sent of the Almighty God in honor of the promises made in covenant and testament to their Fathers.
For Yahweh is the great everlasting God who sits on high and will now move to reveal himself to his creation and I, Christ Jesus, am the everlasting Lord of Lords and King of Kings of whose kingdom there is never an end. And I will send my two prophets, even my two candlesticks who will prophecy, and I will send my 144,000 to save alive those to whom they are sent in the wilderness in a place chosen by Yahweh and of Yahweh will they be fed and cared for. And the everlasting God has so declared of old. For it is Yahweh who speaks of things that are yet to be as though they have already happened for so are the ways of The Everlasting God who has given me The Everlasting Gospel to be declared over the earth so that everlasting salvation may come to all who will call on my mighty, everlasting name.
I Yeshua HaMashiach, even Christ Jesus, have sent these words by my servant and by my servant have these words been sent.

I am the Word of God made flesh who dwells amongst you I am he who sits with billow in hand stoking the flames of purification I am he who removes the unbelief I am he who removes your faithless ways I am he who fully purifies you of all manner of fleshly corruption

And I am he who is the Lion of the tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and to make war and execute judgment on the fallen ones, and the hour of judgment is now here. And so I counsel those who dwell on the earth to follow Yahweh’s words and Kiss the Son, lest I become angry, and you perish from the way, when my wrath is kindled but a little.
Blessed are all they who put their trust in me, even Yeshua HaMashiach and all who call on my name to the end shall be saved, even all those who are heirs of salvation from before the foundations of the earth were laid.

Now is the Time.
AUGUST 24, 2024
It is time, my children, it is time. It is time to come home, when the trumpet sounds and my church is gathered, where Yahweh awaits with joy in his heart for your sudden arrival. It is time to come home, when the trumpet blast calls the children of the most high to go where the angels live and roam. It is time my children for me to gather you from the four corners of the earth, even all who have fallen asleep in Christ will rise first and you who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds. For I Christ Jesus am your living Lord and Savior, and I am calling you to your home in the heavens where your rewards await, where I have prepared you a place in my Father’s house, for in my Father’s house are many mansions. I am calling you home to stand before your Lord, so all may receive of the things done in the body, whether good or bad, that all may receive of the Lord their reward, and that all may take their places in the orders of the heavens that are prepared for each of you.
Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach, and I am the bridegroom who is approaching to gather my bride for the times of our wedding has arrived, where I will enter into everlasting covenant with my chosen, even those who have made themselves ready, and I have cleansed in my atoning blood because they came to me fully and gave their entire hearts to me in love and commitment. Although they did not walk perfectly, and many overcame grievous sin, they did cleanse themselves fully in the blood of the lamb, and they now stand before me fully cleansed from their sins and are as pure as virgins who have committed no fornication and have kept themselves from the evil one. Behold! My over-comers that I have forgiven from all sin and have poured oil in their lamps because they came to me in their times of need and I showed them how to trim their wicks and I did heal them and set them apart for myself, even all that Yahweh has chosen from before the foundations of the world to stand as my bride and be with me forevermore, and they will reign with me as everlasting Kings and Priests for so they are called, sanctified and chosen in me, Christ Jesus their resurrected Lord.
And my 144,000 will be changed and sealed and fully recreated for the purposes that they have been called and prepared to accomplish. Truly, truly, every soul who has believed on my mighty name and made me their everlasting Lord will be changed fully and recreated newly as a new creation, and they will be fashioned as I am. And never again will they sin, either through pride nor ungodliness and never again will they be cursed, and never again will sickness or pain, or death or sorrow ever touch them again for the former things are passed away and the true light now shines. And it is I, Christ Jesus, who will now move to reveal himself to Jacob and whosoever calls on my mighty name to the end shall be saved, even all the dwellers on the earth who are ordained to eternal life and there will be a great multitude who will accept me as their Messiah and I will have saved them to the uttermost.
I am coming for you, my loves, and the times are now. I have waited an entire age of grace and have saved many, and many will be risen to newness of life in me, Christ Jesus their eternal Lord, and the dead in Christ will rise first, and the last trumpet is at the ready now. Many signs miracles and wonders have covered the earth in their splendor and the signs are non-stop around the world now that announce my appearing, that announce the marriage of the Lamb to his faithful bride, and the banquet halls in the heavens are prepared and at the ready.

And so it is, a heavenly celebration awaits my faithful, called, and chosen, and now is time for them to cease forever from their labors that they have labored in the earth in their houses of clay, and they have labored in the flesh as my fellow workers and have gathered and brought many to me, the Lord Jesus Christ that they may receive everlasting salvation forevermore. For though their flesh was corrupted in sin by Satan, I have given them a purpose and called them to leave forever the futility of which they were condemned by sin.
And so they have this treasure in earthen vessels that the power of God does live and dwell in them, and they did many mighty works in my name, and I am he who empowered them to become heirs of salvation and heirs of eternal life and I have redeemed them and given that eternal down payment in the new birth and I have sealed them all with that holy spirit of promise, even that unbreakable seal of promise. And now it is time to fully redeem the purchased possession, even all who have made me Lord from a faith filled heart knowing that Yahweh raised me from the dead to die no more. Now are the times of their full redemption where they will receive fully of their down payment received of me in the new birth of Christ in you the hope of glory!
Behold! Hear my voice and understand my words and know that your glorious future is not years away, nor is it set to arrive in Jubilees to come, but is upon you my loves and suddenly in an eternal instant will you all be changed and the times of change are now. You will find yourselves suddenly transformed into eternal glory, and I will clothe you in spotless garments that can never be soiled. Suddenly will you find yourselves standing in Yahweh’s throne room, even in the Father of Light’s eternal splendor and glory, and you will partake forevermore of his eternal nature for you are sons of the living God, even all who were taken from Adam and redeemed from red earth.
And it was my atoning blood that was poured out on the earth at Golgotha that secured your salvation once, and forevermore as I gave up my life with the words “It is finished!” And I Christ Jesus, am forevermore the resurrected and ascended Lord of Lords and King of Kings because Yahweh raised me from the dead to die no more! I am the last Adam, and I am the son of man who has redeemed the sons of men who called on my name and made them into eternal sons of God who will evermore live in everlasting glory and eternal splendor and forevermore will Yahweh be glorified in them, and them in Yahweh for in me, Yeshua HaMashiach does all fullness dwell forevermore, and Yahweh will be all in all and forevermore will we move as one new creation and one new man. And you, my called chosen and faithful, are forevermore redeemed, and you are about to understand your true lives for your lives are everlasting. So understand that you are dead, and your lives are hidden with me, Christ Jesus, in Yahweh. When I, Christ Jesus, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with me in glory. Know you not that your true selves are hidden in me, Christ Jesus?
So why are you downcast my chosen, my faithful, my Church and even my Bride? I am coming for you and behold, I am approaching for you. And I will gather you suddenly to myself. And as the earth spins into judgment and war, the heavens will rejoice at your presence and great celebration will there be when the sons of God are forevermore united with their Lord of Lords and King of Kings in everlasting glory and newness of life will be had by all. And there will never more be a separation between those who are redeemed by the blood of the Lamb and their Father and their God.
For now is the time that Yahweh has chosen to begin to fully reveal himself to his creation and his revealing of himself fully starts with the house of God, and he is about to reveal himself fully to his chosen and

faithful, even the first-fruits, for those whom I gather to myself at the sound of the last trump are the first fruits from the dead. And now it is time for them to fully know, even as all of you are fully known of me and my Father. And so I announce my appearing and I counsel you my faithful to continue to make yourselves ready for my appearing, for now are the times as judgment begins at the house of God. And suddenly, will it occur.
Behold! Fear not the coming storms that many of you see gathering: storms of war, storms of approaching calamity, storms of natural disasters that are surely about to take place. Understand that nothing will in any way harm you, though many live in temptations and spiritual warfare that is won fully in me, Christ Jesus. Behold! The time of my appearing for my faithful is here and as the birth pangs are non-stop and suddenly will they be gathered and snatched from judgment that is not for them.

911 Emergency Alert
AUGUST 31, 2024
911 Emergency Alert! 911 Emergency Alert! 911 Emergency Alert! So declares your everlasting Lord! Truly, truly, I have called! Truly, truly, I have cried! Truly, truly, I have mourned! Truly, truly, I have warned! And so the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach has heralded forth the judgments to come in warning to all who had ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart to comprehend. And yet my remnant has heard my voice and made themselves ready for the appearing of their everlasting Lord and savior, who is both the Lamb of God and the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.
Behold! The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, and I, Christ Jesus, do possess the deed to the earth, for it is my inheritance. And I paid the price in my atoning blood, that the earth should not utterly perish in sin and unrighteousness, because Yahweh has preserved his creation so that all who are called and chosen, even all those born of red earth who are called to eternal life, should be born again of incorruptible seed, and they will stand in the throne room of Yahweh as newborns, even those born again into everlasting righteousness into eternity at the appointed time, and the time is now! Though babes they will not be, but powerful and everlasting kings and priests, for so is their inheritance, and in such manner will they serve Yahweh under my rule; for I am the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I am your everlasting high priest forevermore after the order of Melchizedek, and my rule has no end.
Hear my voice, and bow your hearts in obedience, and incline your ears to wisdom, and hear the words of your Bridegroom, my Bride! Truly, I am speaking to the faithful, and I ask your hearts in full obedience to my words. For the times of warning are closing and nearly completed, and the birth pangs are nonstop now. For I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am the last Adam and have been made a life-quickening spirit and have been changed forevermore, and after the flesh I am known no more.
Truly, truly, I was fashioned after the likeness of sinful flesh, but in the sinful blood of Adam I have no part nor lot, nor did I ever share in the corruption of corrupted, sinful flesh. I am the last Adam, and as mankind is fashioned after Adam at their natural birth, and as sin and death came through Adam’s disobedience, so too shall righteousness and eternal life be created fully within you by me, Christ Jesus, suddenly as I gather the faithful to myself. Of a great truth, I am the last Adam, and I have been made a life-giving spirit, and in righteousness and true holiness will you now be born again into all eternity.
And even though all who have been born of a woman (except the Lamb of God) fully partake of the corruption sowed into the flesh by Satan on account of Adam’s disobedience, so too will all who are born again of my incorruptible seed fully partake of righteousness and true holiness. For every last one of you will be re-created perfectly, sinless, and fully righteous as the everlasting and eternal sons of God, of whom I will ordain my kings and priests and of whom I will take to myself my bride in eternal, holy covenant, and evermore will they be with me, never to depart.
Yet, so was the son of God manifested that I might destroy the works of the Devil, for the Devil sins from the beginning. Yahweh himself is my Father, for he has created me for such a purpose, to be the last Adam, even he whom in the likeness the newly created man will be fashioned. So understand that I, Christ Jesus, am the head, and a new man will I re-create you all because you are my body, and you will all serve a vital

The BITTER SWEET

function for which you all have been created. Understand that even though I took the likeness of sinful flesh, the sins of your fathers did not pass to me through the blood. For Yahweh himself created me in righteousness and true holiness, even that God was manifest in the flesh; for he who has seen me has seen the Father, yet after the flesh I am known no more.
And so I was given for your redemption and rescue. He that has seen me has seen the Father, and my Father and I are one in unity and purpose, except in his throne Yahweh is greater than I, for there is none like the great eternal God! Yet in the womb did I develop in like manner as any man, yet in the womb is no passing of blood from the mother to the child; and so was I sanctified and born sinless as the lamb of God, and so have I given myself as the perfect Passover as the high priest of Yahweh after the everlasting order of Melchizedek for remission of sins for all who choose to accept my offer of everlasting life.
And now I come as the lion of the tribe of Judah because once again I have been rejected by those to whom I turned. And as I was rejected by Israel, even my own to whom I was sent, and as a result turned to the Gentiles, so now the Gentiles have rejected me, and I return now to Israel, even back to my own land of promise, for I will yet save a remnant from Jacob that I may save some of all. And from the throne of David will the earth be ruled from the land of promise, promised long ago by Yahweh, and what Yahweh has promised will be fulfilled to the uttermost! And I am he who is given for the fulfillment of all things.
Behold! The times are now, the times are now, when the new birth will come to full completion and consummation in me, the Lord Jesus Christ, and I will fulfill Yahweh’s eternal purposes of old, which he has prepared in times past (even of times so ancient you cannot comprehend at this time) because you have always been hidden away in Yahweh’s heart. Nevertheless, the eternal and everlasting purposes of Yahweh are now set to be fulfilled, and the first-fruits harvest is at hand, and the hour is upon you. For the earth has now become as a woman in labor, ready to give birth, and her travail and her labor pains are nonstop now, and her deliverance draws near, and the hour of resurrection and gathering is here.
For suddenly will it happen when I, Christ Jesus, will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and that last trumpet will sound, and at that sound my appearing will break across the sky in great brilliance (my glory is everlasting brightness), and the world will know there is a God in heaven and the world will understand the day of the Lord is upon them. And so the earth will give birth to all those who have fallen asleep in Christ and have returned to the dust of the earth, and whose spirits returned to God, and whose souls have been in sweet rest since the day they closed their eyes to sleep in red earth. For the old man of red earth will spring forth in newness of life, and the earth shall deliver up at my command those who have fallen asleep in Christ, and you who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds with them to meet me in the air. And it will happen suddenly, and you all will be born into everlasting splendor and re-created fully as a newborn creation of which everlasting power and splendor is woven into your pure white garments with which you will suddenly find yourselves clothed, and the times are now.
Woe to the inhabitants of the earth. Woe, woe, much woe to the inhabitants of the earth. Woe to you, natural man, because you have refused my call. 911 emergency alert have I warned, and call, and now the day has come upon you, and you are still ignorantly unaware of your impending destruction. You, natural man, have ignored the voices of those I sent, and I have sent many voices to you, and you have rejected my apostles and prophets and my ambassadors; and even the children did you reject, because in the mouths

The BITTER SWEET

of babes have I perfected praise, and the little ones have dreamed dreams and been given visions, and they faithfully announce my appearing! And so it will be that sudden destruction will fall and the warnings shall cease. For this is not a warning but a declaration because the times of warning are about to suddenly cease, and in place of warning will fulfillment stand, and sudden destruction will fall suddenly, and you will not escape, oh, inhabitants of the earth who reject your creator.
Natural man, you go from sin to sin in your filthy sinful ways, and although I have showered the earth in my grace and mercy so that you may escape your impending judgment, you instead have chosen to bear your judgment and calamity, and so shall it be. And so now judgment begins with the house of God, and so will it be. Secret Babylon, even that great nation of United States, now stands chained, naked, and destitute and awaits her final destruction.
Because of her sins, fornications, adulteries, abominations, and utter filth and depravity with which she has corrupted the earth, she will now face her destruction. And the great harlot is now given fully into the hands of her enemies, yet the restrainer restrains until there is a restrainer to restrain no more, and suddenly will the restrainer be removed at the great gathering together of my saints! And at which time the restrainer is removed, they will execute their secret attack that they have planned and coordinated for many years now, for so is given into their hands to accomplish, and Secret Babylon will utterly be destroyed in one hour.
And the ten horns will destroy the great harlot because they hate the whore, and they shall make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and will burn her with fire. And great shaking will come on the earth, and she will be split, and the waters will cover her coasts, and the waters will cover her heart, and she will be divided asunder. For so it is written: her sins are come up into heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. Reward her, even as she has rewarded you, and give her double according to her works: and in the cup that she has filled to you, you fill her double. Inasmuch as she glorified herself and lived in pleasure, so much give you to her torment and sorrow: for she says in her heart, I sit being a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning. Therefore, shall her plagues come at one day, death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire: for that God which condemns her, is a strong Lord. Then a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, With such violence shall that great city Babylon be cast, and shall be found no more.
And so will it be that this once great nation, of which I have redeemed many, will now be taken in judgment, even as my Church and my Bride are taken into the heavens, where I have prepared for them a place of safety and refuge where they will receive their inheritance. And never again shall Secret Babylon be, and her greatest city that arrogantly sits as though nothing will ever change will fall completely along with her, never to rise again.
Truly, truly, all of her sinful and disgusting cites will fall, and her towers will tumble, and great fires and destruction will make her roads impassable. Then will the red armies, even the armies of the beast that he has imported for her destruction, be unleashed on what remains, and they will consume her flesh. And so it will be that whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Yet, those that remain are sold into slavery by usury because the leaders of Secret Babylon have betrayed her citizens and have given them as collateral, and payment is now due.
Understand what has happened, my people, and remember my words. The mangy shepherds have worked

283

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE

The BITTER SWEET

together for her destruction; the one mangy shepherd who rules in secret puppeteers the old stooge, while the other mangy shepherd who appears persecuted by the old stooge works hand in hand with the mangy shepherd who rules in secret. For they pretend they are enemies at the present time, but they are all from the same mangy flock, fulfilling the dragon’s purposes, and so I told my Church, my Body, and even my Bride! And so the mangy shepherds have delivered Secret Babylon into the hands of her enemies, for so they are sent.
They have made the whore naked, for so was given them to accomplish, for even the enemies of Yahweh obey his voice. Understand they have purposely left her military might in foreign lands and given her secrets to the ten horns so they may rule in strength. It is the ten horns who will give their power to the beast, for so is given them to accomplish.
The great whore has fought endless and futile wars designed to wear down her strength. Secret Babylon has by design instigated war with the Bear in order to grind down her strength and might so that she is now left naked and defenseless, and into the red dragon’s hands is she now given as spoil. And every facet of her empire that sits on many waters will likewise be given as spoil into their hands. Understand that they are at the ready and will move suddenly to execute in unison their worldwide attack, and on all fronts will they attack in swift destruction, and a very short victory will they have before judgment falls in great wrath on the earth.
Understand that the earth is now ruled by the Dragon, and he is now bound to the earth as he awaits his judgment, and so shall his kingdom be utterly destroyed and punished (for he is no king), and Satan will be bound in punishment with a great chain in the abyss for the appointed time, for a thousand years is so given for a day of rest for the redeemed, and many Sabbaths will we have. And so his tentacles stretch and cover the kings of the earth like an octopus wraps its prey, and in the same way a spider weaves its web; so he takes his prey, and all that are taken are preserved for that great lake of fire.
For the spider sits in its lair, and the spider has hidden itself amongst the land of promise. And so are Satan’s ways, for Satan’s ways are cowardly. He has slithered on his belly and tried to hide himself amongst the garden of Yahweh, but nothing is hidden from Yahweh’s sight, and nothing is hidden from my sight, for I am Yeshua HaMashiach, who is the promised seed of the woman. And I will bruise the serpent’s head, and an everlasting wound will it be, of which he will never recover.
But so it is that his tares share of his evil nature, and so the spider has woven the world into its web through much evil, and the spider now sits at the ready, for its hour has come. And so the spider now moves with its many legs into position the pieces on the board, so that they are at the ready. It has lured the world into its web, falsely promising a new day; and a revival of their golden age they seek to have, but they never will have their golden age, but a great lake of fire that burns the hottest flames of blue is their inheritance.
And so the spider moves them across its web and positions them at the ready. The spider is the synagogue of Satan, who has invaded my lands of inheritance and promise, and they will be utterly rooted out and destroyed, and no root nor posterity will they have. Yet they will serve the eternal purposes of Yahweh for a short season, for a multitude of multitudes will be saved from destruction during Daniel’s seventieth week. All who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved, says the Righteous Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who is Jesus Christ in the English tongue; and in whatever language they call, they will be heard and saved and raised to newness of life, and into my righteous kingdom will they go in everlasting reward and

everlasting splendor.
And so it is, the destruction of Secret Babylon is now at hand, and my faithful are to be removed. And I, Christ Jesus, no longer come to the dwellers on the earth in warning because I have warned them thoroughly and in many ways only to be denied on all points; and so it is, for so it is written. However, in spite of Yahweh’s foreknowledge, Yahweh still warns those about to be taken in judgment of their impending fate, and in his love he has sent me for their salvation, and many were saved.
But now they have rejected me in favor of their false savior, for they now follow Barabbas, and they have now chosen the Dragon as their god. And so I no longer come to warn natural man but to instruct and prepare my people so that they are at the ready for their departing, because there is no more time. Yahweh, in spite of knowing all of this in eternities past, and in his justice and love, has warned the unrepentant anyway, even knowing that many will not repent at this time, yet a multitude of multitudes will be saved through the refiner’s fire of Jacob’s trouble. And all who call on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved!
But many have turned to me, and it is to you, my Bride and my Church and my Body, that I now come to gather and prepare for your departing into the heavens, for now are the times and the times are now. Understand, my children, that this is no longer the world you are used to living in, and the days of old are now past, and the day of the Lord is here. So I counsel and instruct all in my Church, even as many as who will hear my voice to fill their lamps with the oil that I have provided and to trim your wicks as I have instructed, for the day of your redemption has come. Truly, truly, I no longer warn but am here to declare on behalf of Yahweh, the great eternal God, that the times have come; and what Yahweh declares can no man alter, nor change even in the slightest, and all will come to pass as written.
And so, my children, understand the times in which you live because you can no longer live careless lives. Events are already underway and the times are perilous. Hide yourselves, my little ones, from the judgments that are not for you, and understand that even the waters are starting to turn bitter. I ask you, my children, to remain in the safety that I have provided for you and come out from amongst them now and be fully separate so that you do not share in their plagues. These events I speak of are not for you, my children, but are given to wake the last of those who will come to salvation before Yahweh closes the door of the ark at the gathering of my Church at the last trumpet, and very few there are that remain.
So hearken to my voice, my children, and come out, come out, come out from among her. Emergency 911 alert, for the day is at hand. Calamities are already unleashed on the earth, yet I have provided safety and peace for those who await my shout, and the trumpet is about to sound. Therefore, remain in the safety of the havens I have prepared for you, and calamity that is not intended for you will pass over you in the same way the angel of death passed over the children of Israel in Egypt. Except, suddenly on the earth you will no longer be, and in a fallen state will you never be again, for your redemption no longer draws near, but is fully upon you. Therefore, stay at the ready.

I am speaking to the faithful and I ask your hearts in full obedience to my words. I am known after the flesh no more. I am the last Adam.

I require the full hearts of my faithful, so continue to purify yourselves in my atoning blood and confess your sins to me so that I may fully purify you in my atoning blood. Do not be fooled by your senses, because Secret Babylon is blind and deaf and willingly ignorant of her impending judgment, which is already underway and cannot be stopped. Therefore, share not in her blindness that you suffer not of her plagues, and be separate from among them so you are fully ready for the appearing of your everlasting Lord. Behold, my Bride!

By Deception They Do War!
SEPTEMBER 2, 2024
Behold! What fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird? But truly, truly, a trap is being set for the people of the promised land, and war is on the earth as wrath and judgment is set to fall. Gather yourselves to the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach and hear my words. Behold! I tell you of things to come before they happen, that my words may stand as a warning to all to whom they are sent. For so is the nature of the words of life of which I speak, for I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am the Word of God made flesh, and I dwell within you, for you are the temple of the living God, and I am the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
Truly, truly, my words will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those to whom they are sent, and they will be preserved through the coming wars and troubles, except there will be a dearth of scripture worldwide because when the earth was showered generously in the words of Yahweh, even the great eternal God, the world did receive those words for a time. But now the world has rejected Yahweh’s words in favor of the lies of the Dragon, and so now the Word of God will be scarce, and a famine of God’s Word will there be, for so are the coming judgments. Yet, every living soul who calls on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved, even those who love not their lives to the end.
But hear and understand my words, and know and understand that my words will be preserved, and they will be revealed to the world, and the times of revealing have come. And so I, Yeshua HaMashiach, do send the everlasting gospel for times of great trouble, even Jacob’s trouble, so that a multitude of multitudes may be saved so as yet by fire. And so the everlasting gospel has come to be revealed in its time, and testimonies will yet be written, and the words of Yahweh will flow as rivers of living water, and they are written for the obedience of all who have ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart to learn. And the words of Yahweh are eternal words of which no man can lose, corrupt, nor silence, for a man in so doing will lose himself, yet the words of the everlasting God stand eternal.
Behold! The times of Jacob’s trouble have arrived, and the times have come for the revealing of all things, for Yahweh has chosen this time to reveal himself to his creation, even in the face of his only begotten son, Jesus Christ. For I am Jesus Christ, even the ascended Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and into my hands has the deed to the earth been given because I purchased it in my own sinless blood, and my reward is with me. And I will distribute my inheritance among the faithful, and he that overcomes will inherit all things at my hand in reward for their faithfulness, that they may evermore show the everlasting glory of Yahweh. And Yahweh will glorify them, and those who have lowered themselves in humility, obedience, and repentance will be elevated in everlasting glory and will shine as the stars in the firmament, and so their glory will shine for all eternity. So I encourage you, my loves, to hear my voice and bow your hearts in obedience.
Hear me, and hear me well; war is here, and Secret Babylon is chained for destruction; and her judgment and punishment lingers not but is imminent. And as I snatch my Church, my Body, and even my Bride away from calamity into the safety of the heavens, the restrainer will be removed, and they will have their surprise attack, and the time of their attack is now. The ten kings have colluded among themselves, and they have surely set their hands to the ready; they have staged, they have prepared, and they have covered

The BITTER SWEET

the earth in their lies, that they may seem justified in the genocide of millions and millions that will fall to the tragedy and pains of their war.
And it is Satan’s own synagogue who controls the world now, and they hide themselves in the land of promise like a spider hides itself out of sight of its prey until the prey lands in its web. Truly, truly, they have woven their web worldwide, and they have caught the kings of the earth in their webs of deception, for by deception they do war, and also murder, bribery, blackmail, extortion, and many other evils. For their ways are utterly perverse, because Satan places the lowest of the low and those who are utterly corrupt as world leaders so that they may be easily controlled and used completely by the tares whom Satan has planted among Yahweh’s fields of wheat. And the times of the final harvests are approaching where the wheat shall be gathered into Yahweh’s everlasting storehouse through the coming harvests, and Satan’s tares will be utterly rooted out, bound, and cast alive into that fiery lake of burning brimstone that burns the hottest flames of blue in the inheritance of their fathers; and so is their future, so fear them not.
But so it is, the spider rules its web as it seeks to take control of the earth; for the earth is given into the hands of the dragon in a limited way for a short time, even Daniel’s seventieth week, of which times are now. And so the faithful in my Church will be taken into the heavens into great reward, and they will receive their inheritance, and the bridegroom will join his bride in everlasting covenant, and evermore will they be with me wherever I go. And so the title deed to the earth that I hold in my hands that is currently sealed is set to be unsealed, and the seals will be loosed, and they will blow their trumpets, and the vials will be poured out in wrath. And great judgment and devastation will cover the earth, and calamity will fall worldwide as the final war to synthesize the nations under Satan’s control rages along, that the beast and the false prophet may rise and rule the earth in great cruelty, and so it will be. They will declare war on all things of the true God, and Christianity will be illegal, and it is given to the beasts to make war on the saints and to overcome them, and many will lose their heads for my name’s sake, and all who do will find their lives eternally in great reward and eternal splendor, and they will live everlasting lives of peace, and they will enjoy the fat of the land.
Yet, as the world is brought to its faithless knees in submission to pure evil through great war, cruelty, and devastation, the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will rise fully, though they currently pretend to be enemies in their current manipulations and deceit to destroy Secret Babylon. Understand that their father is the same, for they are Satan’s own, even that abominable duo of which the dragon has chosen to fulfill his purposes. And so the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will rise, and they will broker peace amongst the nations, except a false peace will it be. Understand that there is no peace outside of the peace treaty given by Yahweh for the sins of the world, for I, Jesus the Nazarene, am the prince of peace and I do bring an everlasting peace, and in righteousness will I rule the earth from the land of promise from the throne of David, for I am his rightful heir.
And so they will rise. The third world war will be fomented amongst those who bow at their black cube and they will make war on the earth as they seek to eradicate anything to do with the name Jesus Christ. Except those who bow to their black cube will be brought fully under control of the beast from the sea, who will lead them as their Mahdi. And those in the lands of promise will have their false king, false prophet, false Moshiach, and a beastly temple builder will he be, and the beast from the earth will so lead them in great deception. And those who wear the black cube on their foreheads will broker peace with those who

288

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

bow at their black cube, and the world will be united as they follow these beasts and say among themselves, who is like the beast? And who can make war with the beast? Yet I, Christ Jesus, who am King of Kings and Lord of Lords, will come to judge and make war, and I will utterly destroy the beast and the false prophet, and they will be cast alive into that great lake burning with fire and brimstone where they will wait for the Dragon to join them at the appointed time.
And so they will make grand promises of peace and security, and they will gather those who are forever lost to their destruction. They will promise a new society and a new order that will require their beastly mark to participate, so take not the mark. With their mark they will promise a cure from pestilence and will promise health and long life, and a great future will they imagine for themselves, and they will make many false promises to those who will perish from taking their beastly mark.
And so I say again to those who dwell on the earth, that all may hear:
IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND RECEIVE HIS MARK IN HIS FOREHEAD, OR IN HIS HAND, THE SAME SHALL DRINK OF THE WINE OF THE WRATH OF GOD, WHICH IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE INTO THE CUP OF HIS INDIGNATION, AND HE SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB: AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCENDS UP FOR EVER AND EVER. AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT, WHO WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND WHOSOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF HIS NAME.
But understand, my children, that their society will have no peace, and their promises are bait to lure the unsuspecting into their trap; for what fowler sets the snare in the sight of the bird? Yet many birds will be taken in their snare, even all those whose names were never written in the Book of Life. Understand that all who take the mark will be forever altered, and they will have committed blasphemy against Yahweh, by changing their DNA and thereby corrupting the image of God in which man was made, and all who do have no forgiveness, so take not their mark. It is better to lose your earthly lives that I may save you eternally and that you may find eternal life in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, by calling on my name to the end than to foolishly try to save your earthly lives and lose any chance of eternal life to the second death of eternal flames where their worm dies not. So choose wisely!
The world that will rise from the ashes of war will be a world of pestilence, death, famine, pollution, injustice, cruelty, madness, and utter misery. All pleasure will be taken from the earth, and yet the beast from the earth will force his mark on the world, even the serpent’s bite, and any and all who resist will lose their lives. And that is the choice many will have to make to obtain eternal life in salvation, and all who call on the name of the Lord until the end will be saved. Yet, their new society will bring no peace, and all who take the mark will be part of the hive mind, and they will be mingled with technologies, and they will be slaves to the will of the dragon, and him will they serve, and into that great lake of fire will they go, and so is the second death.
The Dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth will lead a coalition of kings, and they will make war on all who seek to live the ways of Yahweh, and they will blame me, Yeshua HaMashiach, for the calamities that befall the earth. In judgment and in great rebellion will they blaspheme the name of the God of heaven and his only begotten son, and great blasphemous claims will they make. The beast from the

THE

sea and the beast from the earth will align themselves against my two witnesses and my two candlesticks and will stand in opposition to them with many lying signs and wonders, and many blasphemous words will they speak. And when my two witnesses and two candlesticks have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. Yet in three and a half days will they be resurrected, and a great voice from heaven will say to them, Come up hither. And they will ascend up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies will behold them.
And so the beast from the earth, even he who comes with his beastly mark in hand, even he who will be their false prophet and false Moshiach, will come to rule the land of promise. And he has already ingratiated himself to the rulers of the land, even the leaders of the synagogue of Satan, for he shares of their corrupted bloodlines, and he is proud of his genealogy, and Dan is a lion’s whelp of which no Messiah will ever arise. And so he will build their temple as they foolishly seek to reestablish the law of Moses, which things are fulfilled in utter perfection in my sacrifice of myself as the Lamb of God, for I am he who gave myself as the perfect Passover for the sins of mankind. But what fowler sets the snare in the sight of the bird?
Truly, truly, they will lay a snare in Zion, and they will seek to take those of the land, because Satan seeks to destroy every last soul of the race of Adam, even the human race; and had the days of Jacob’s trouble not been shortened, no flesh would be left alive. But so the stage will be set with their third temple, where the abomination of desolation will happen. And so have I warned: When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso reads, let him understand). Then let them which be in Judea, flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the house top, not come down, to take anything out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field, return to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days. But pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day: For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
Understand that this period of time is near and will occur after the first 42 months of Jacob’s trouble. During the first 42 months, the two witnesses will prophesy, and they will build their temple when such a thing is no longer necessary; for I, Jesus the Nazarene, am the perfect Passover for the sins of mankind forevermore. Yet, these brute beasts stand in opposition to me, and the beast from the earth will endeavor to place himself as their false Moshiach, and this is their trap.
They will appeal to those of the land who still reject me, Yeshua HaMashiach, their true Messiah, and many will run and gather themselves to their false Moshiach, yet they ignorantly follow him to their own demise. Because the beast from the earth is he who sets a trap in the land, and he will lure many into his web of deceit; then the spider will spring forth on its prey, and he will betray the people of the land. Have you not read? For so, it is written: Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a departing first, and that that man of sin be disclosed, even the son of perdition, Which is an adversary, and will exalt himself against all that is called God, or that is worshiped: so that he does sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. So understand that the departing first is where I will gather the faithful in my Church to me to meet me in the air and at that time the restrainer will be removed and that man of sin will be revealed in his time.
But when has Yahweh ever left heirs of salvation to eternal destruction, and I declare it openly before it

occurs: That I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will yet save a remnant of Jacob, and many from the land will accept me as their Messiah. And I will rescue them. Behold, it is written: And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on mount Sion, and with him 144,000 having his Father’s Name written in their foreheads. And so it will be that I will come to rescue a remnant from destruction, and I do come with an unstoppable force who will walk step by step as I lead them to lead my little ones to safety. Perhaps you may wonder who the 144,000 are and to what purpose they follow me to Mount Sion?
The 144,000 are chosen by Yahweh before the foundations of the earth for such a time. They are forged in affliction, and they will possess unique abilities and strengths that I will clothe them with in their new garments that I will give, for their garments are tailored specifically for them and will contain their accomplishments and attributes. They will be taken in the gathering of the faithful but are set apart for my purposes, even the purposes of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach. They come during the great tribulation to lead Israel to safety but first are taken to marry Christ, for I am the Bridegroom, and they are my Bride, the called, chosen, faithful, and true, even those whom I have made pure as a virgin in my atoning blood. And it is you, my Bride, who shall serve Yahweh’s purposes at my command in the times of the greatest troubles.
Behold, it is written! And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two hundred, and threescore days. And so it will be that I will provide a place of refuge in the wilderness for my people, for I will yet save Jacob from their troubles, and many from the land of promise will turn to me, Yeshua HaMashiach, who is their true Messiah. And I will save them from the trap that will be set for them, and so I warn all before it happens to stay away from the trap and do not follow them. Do not believe their lying signs and wonders, neither believe their blasphemous words, but call on the name of the Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who is Jesus Christ in the English tongue, because in whatever language a person calls on my name, even they will be saved when they call on my name to the end.
And so I come to make my people aware of the trap that will be set for them by the false prophet who comes with his beastly mark in hand. And so I tell my people plainly before it happens what is to come upon the earth before it occurs. Surely, the Lord God will do nothing, but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets. And I will come to the rescue of many in Israel who would otherwise perish and will lead them into the wilderness to the place prepared of them by Yahweh, and there shall they be fed, and pastured, and cared for until the trouble passes. For it will come to pass at the end of Jacob’s trouble, and so it is written and so shall it be done:
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he has on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, and I have sent these Word by my servant, and by my servant have these words

been sent. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am he who has revealed the everlasting gospel in its time, and the times of revealing are now.
Behold! The times of revealing are come on the earth, and I do declare that Jacob’s trouble, even Daniel’s seventieth week, has arrived. Suddenly will I snatch the faithful from the earth to the safety of the heavens, and suddenly will the restrainer be removed, and suddenly will great calamity, judgment, and tragedy fall on the dwellers of the earth. And all those who are ordained to eternal life will come to salvation in me, Christ Jesus, the eternal resurrected Lord. And Satan’s kingdom will be utterly punished and destroyed, never to rise again.
I am he who does come to judge and to make war, and I do come as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and a remnant of Jacob will I save, and I will rule the earth in righteousness in my millennial kingdom, and I do bring a great host of kings and priests to rule the earth in righteousness at my command.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, the great King of Kings and Lord of Lords, so hear my Words, for the times of their fulfillment has come.

I Bring Giants to Fulfill My Wrath!
SEPTEMBER 3, 2024
Behold, they come! I bring giants to fulfill my wrath! Hear my words, oh dwellers on the earth, even the words of Yahweh, the great eternal God. For as in the days of Noah, so shall it be: And there were giants in the earth in those days, even the days of Jared to the days of Noah were they made and did they roam the earth in great evil. And so as it has been, so will it be, and giants will return. In the days of Jared the watchers descended on mount Hermon, two hundred in all in the days of Jared they did descend from the heavens above. And they bound themselves to mutual imprecations, even their oath wherewith they bound themselves that has become an eternal curse for all who are bound thereby and of which they will never escape, and so they lured and led astray mankind into great sin.
The watchers were enticed by the Satans, according to the lusts of their hearts, and fell to temptation from their glorious first estate, and life eternal did they have in the heavens, for so were they created. Yet they fell, even as falling stars did their fall happen, and they have joined the Satans forevermore. So the Satans enticed willing women and taught them to entice the watchers after the lusts of their hearts, and some women gave themselves willingly to the watchers, and their judgment they will bear. Others were taken by force because the watchers subverted their worldly leaders of old, and they went and took women by force from their husbands and families, and so the watchers took all they chose as their wives, and abused many, and of this unholy union were born giants, even great giants of old. Because the watchers further corrupted the genetics of mankind. And so they sinned against beasts, and birds, and against fishes and against all manners of flesh did they cross one with another, even in willing and hateful disobedience to the boundaries set by me, even Yahweh, the Great Eternal God! From the beginning I created the earth with each seed after its kind, and so boundaries were crossed that never should have been violated, and to cross the natural boundaries that are set by Yahweh is to bring insanity, suffering, and death on the creation of Yahweh, and all who do will bear their judgment. Life is designed as an interrelated tapestry, where all life is connected in peace and harmony, where love rules the day and all seek the well-being of others and not themselves only. Even a creation where there is no lust and evil desire to manifest itself into death and destruction, and so will it be eternally and evermore, and the times of fulfillment are here.
And so four of the chief angels of the heavens, even Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, brought suit against what their former fellows had done on the earth, and so judgment was declared and executed swiftly on all involved and on the earth itself, because the world that then was became utterly corrupted. The Nephilim, even the children of the watchers, were made to war with each other to the death in many great battles amongst opposing tribes, and that because I took peace from amongst them, and they fought to the death and slaughtered each other as their fathers (the watchers) were forced to watch the destruction of their abominable creations they had made for mankind’s destruction. From there, the watchers were bound in punishment and judgment and were kept separate from each other for seventy generations. And so in the same manner that I had to watch my creation that I loved dearly be destroyed by evil abominations, so did I cause the evil beings to destroy each other in punishment to their fathers, and so did I recompense, for I am righteous in my judgments always and forevermore, and I am a God of righteous judgments whose judgments fail not, nor linger from fulfillment.

And so I brought the great flood on the earth, and a violent affair was the flood during the days of Noah. The fountains of the great deep were broken up and water violently broke forth from the earth itself, and the windows of heaven were opened, allowing the waters above the firmament to flood the earth, even above the tallest mountains, and drowned all life on earth, all except eight souls saved alive on the ark, because Noah was found righteous before my gaze. And for this reason I took Noah and commanded him to make an ark according to the specifications given by my hand. And I brought the animals that would be saved alive to him as well, and so Noah was faithful to carry out all that he was commanded, and the flood did come as foretold and declared, for what I declare, even Yahweh the great eternal God, can no one change nor hinder in the least!
And so Enoch, the scribe of old, details the fate of these giants as such, for I, even Yahweh, so declared: And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men, from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; they shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling. And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst, and cause offenses. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded from them.
And so it is that at the proper time, Noah landed on Mount Ararat, where the ark came to rest as the waters receded. And I did enter into covenant with Noah, and in time Noah’s grandsons began to depart from the covenant I made with Noah, and as a result evil spirits began to attack them. And so these spirits, which were many, overwhelmed the children of Noah’s sons, and so Noah interceded for them, and I did bind nine-tenths of these evil spirits in the abyss, where they have been kept in store from that time until the present day. And so I commanded, and so Noah was taught all their medicines, and seductions was he taught, that Noah might heal them with herbs of the earth. And so one-tenth of these spirits were allowed to remain free, that they might lead astray in wickedness the sons of men who would lust after their lies. And so the remaining spirits that were bound for judgment in the abyss will be released in the times of Jacob’s trouble, when the abyss is fully opened and the nine-tenths of them that are so bound will be released to work their vile and evil ways as part of natural man’s judgment that is here, and will break forth across the earth suddenly and with great destruction!
And so Canaan, Noah’s grandson that Noah cursed on account of his wickedness, committed great sin (once again) using fallen-angel knowledge, and in the ways of Satan did he willingly go, of which he was willingly led, and he did make more abominations after the flood of Noah. And these abominations did infest the lands of Shem that were given by lot of inheritance, of which the accursed Canaan did usurp and steal for himself, and they called his stolen land the land of Canaan. Many of his abominable offspring were genetically altered creations that utterly infested the lands of promise, of which I did send Moses to gather the children of Israel from the lands of Egypt to take their inheritance from the abominable ones. And so did Joshua do great war against these abominations as recorded in the holy writings, and they took from these abominations their rightful inheritance, and so it is recorded as a shadow of things to come. For in like manner will my son, Yeshua HaMashiach, whom I have made Lord of Lords and Kings of Kings, come to take his inheritance from the squatters and usurpers, for their occupation is unlawful. They are no kings

and they have no kingdom, but a great lake burning with fire and brimstone is their everlasting inheritance.
Yet, Israel was not fully faithful in their calling, and a remnant of giants was allowed to remain. But even in their disobedience I have restrained these abominations and destroyed many of them from the earth since those times. And I have driven many of them underground, and many of them went into unknown lands beyond the ice where mankind does not freely roam. Understand that mankind does not understand the earth on which he is made and of which he lives, for mankind feasts on spurious lies sold for truth, repackaged as education, and so mankind willingly remains ignorant that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
And so in time I removed giants from the earth in my mercy and grace and my desire to save mankind from destruction, and their remains are scattered around the earth and litter my creation as a witness of their existence. Even the remains of their civilizations of old still stand in witness that they once ruled an empire of tribes on the earth during their so-called golden age, even in the days of Noah before the flood. Their megalithic ruins are scattered about as a witness against them, and the very existence of these ruins stand as witness against Satan’s own lies, who diligently seeks to hide the truth so that he may have fully his surprise attack. And so I tell those with ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart to learn what is to happen before it happens, so their hearts do not fail them in surprise and unbelief, but that they may know the truth and be prepared for what is to come that they may be saved, even all who call on the name of Jesus Christ until their end.
So it was declared and so it has come to pass in the fullness of times, that I released the watchers from their prisons where they were bound in torment and punishment, separately from each other were they bound. And so they were released after the times of their binding were completed: even seventy generations. History cannot fully hide their release, and many wars and cataclysms and other events happened worldwide with their release, and they did hurl themselves on the east, and they have joined themselves to Satan’s rebellion, fully, once again, for so did they bind themselves forevermore in their accursed oath, and in the lake of fire will their oaths be fulfilled for all eternity, for they are bound to Satan’s punishment and inheritance forevermore.
And so they have prepared themselves in the time given and in a restrained manner for several jubilees now. They have surely produced their abominations once again, and in secret do they prepare themselves and await the removal of the restrainer when they will try once again to break the boundaries I have set for them, for they are ever rebellious. And even though they are bound to fulfill the purposes of El Shaddai, for I am the Almighty God, they will seek to reestablish their golden age and take the earth for themselves, of which is impossible; for the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, and the title deed to the earth has been purchased by my son, Yeshua HaMashiach, and into his mighty hands is it given as an everlasting inheritance, and he will share it fully with the faithful, called, chosen, and redeemed.
And so it is that the Satans and the watchers have readied themselves, and they do eagerly await the removal of the restrainer, for in that removal is their kingdom fully released, and the earth will once again become as in the days of Noah. Behold! I give command, and I bring them: giants are coming to fulfill my wrath, rejoicing at the same time and insulting, and I will allow them to be unleashed on the earth yet once

again in order to fulfill my purposes. They will break free suddenly from where they are hiding, and they are hiding in their cities under the earth, and they are hiding outside the ice of which will shortly be altered, and into the world of men will they be allowed to invade, pillage, and conquer, and the Dragon will lead them for they are part of his kingdom. But only for a short season, even Daniel’s seventieth week, a week of seven years will they be released where each day is a year, and so seven years will it be. And they will devour much, and men’s heart will fail them on account of their fierce countenances and their sheer relative size compared to natural man.
Behold, I AM the great I Am, who has sent my Words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent. And so I tell you things before they happen so that my people will be at the ready and will understand what is to come, and to have discernment as these things will shortly happen. And all who call on the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus Christ in the English tongue, will be saved.
And so it is that the great wrath and great judgment as promised of old is now set to fully come upon the earth, and the times are now, declares the Great Eternal God! For an entire age of grace the gospel of salvation and the great mystery of God (that was revealed to the Apostle Paul) has filled the earth and has gone to the uttermost parts of the earth. And though many, many, many were saved, even all who came to Jesus the Nazarene in full repentance, making him their everlasting Lord, the times have come for fulfillment because mankind has once again rejected their creator. And I, El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, am he who has restrained much evil that the heirs of salvation may come to eternal life in Christ Jesus, their ascended Lord. And so now I declare these things before they happen, for I am Yahweh, the Great I AM! So tell them the GREAT I AM solemnly declares that at the gathering of my faithful children to my son, when they are raised to meet him in the air and as the restrainer is removed, that the entirety of Satan’s kingdom will be unleashed upon the earth and the earth will be altered.
I do declare in judgment upon the inhabitants of the earth that I will unleash Satan’s kingdom in its entirety, and all of their abominations will break forth across the earth, and all those spirits I bound in the abyss during the days of Noah will be released onto the earth, for the times of final separation and final judgment have come on the earth, and the day of the great judgment is set. And so it will be that Satan’s kingdom will be given rule over the earth, because in my justice, mankind has so desired to be ruled by the Satans, even believing his lies that he is a benevolent god and light-bearing enlightener, that I will now give to mankind what they so passionately desire.
And the fallen ones are fully released for their judgment, and they have made their abominations once again. And they are bound to the earth with the dragon, for so is their time, and they will pose as aliens, even benevolent beings from foreign worlds. Yet I, Yahweh the Great Eternal God, do swear by my own name, for I can swear by no higher, that there are no falsely spinning worlds in an ever-expanding expanse of nothingness, but above the earth are the heavens, even the heaven of heavens which is the highest of heavens, where the most High God sits in everlasting sovereignty on his throne and nothing can hide from my gaze.
Behold! They are already making themselves known, and their objects and orbs are all around, and the earth is changing ever so rapidly now. And as natural man has now rejected my peace treaty, even my only begotten son, Jesus the Nazarene, so now do I reject natural man and will leave him to be ruled fully by his enemies, and they do lust for his destruction. Yet, my rejection is not full nor final, because a great

multitude will be saved during Jacob’s trouble, even all those who call on the name of the Lord, even Jesus Christ, until the end. For salvation during Jacob’s trouble can be obtained no other way. So the final separation will begin, and all whom I have ordained to eternal life since before the foundations of the earth were laid will come to eternal life, and I will raise them to newness of life, and great reward will they have.
So hear my words and focus your hearts on my words of warning and declaration, because the times of the Gentiles are now over, and wrath and judgment and great revealing are now upon the earth, because I, even El Shaddai, even the Almighty God, am he who sits on high, and nothing is hidden from my sight, and I will now move to fully save all who are heirs of salvation as I separate them from those who are destined for eternal destruction. And so the wheat shall be separated from the tares forevermore, and all of those who are part of Satan’s rebellion will be given to judgment, and the times of their judgment are set to break forth across the earth.
Hear my Words and understand the severity of what is to come, because the day of the Lord is a day of darkness, and who is able to stand?
I, Yahweh, the Great Eternal God, do declare these things before they happen, and there is no more time. Whosoever will come, let them come to drink freely of the waters of eternal life, and my invitation to life eternal stands, and all those who call on the name of the Lord till the end will be saved.
I, Yahweh, the Great Eternal God, have sent these Words by my servant, and by my servant have these Words been sent!
The times are now!

The Riddle of Three!
SEPTEMBER 5, 2024
Hear the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, my loves, and come to me for comfort and find rest in my love for you, my little ones. For you have been faithful over a few things, and I will now make you ruler over much as you enter the joy of your Lord. Judgment is not for you, my faithful; even all those who are in Christ and all those who have fallen asleep in Christ will be raised to newness of life suddenly and in the twinkling of an eye. For of a truth, I will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall be raised to life incorruptible and you which are alive and remain will be caught up with them in the clouds and so shall you ever be with and like your everlasting Lord. You will be instantly changed from your current fallen state to a fully redeemed creation of incorruption, even created newly as one new man, and as I am, so too will you be; and as it is written, so suddenly shall it be done.
Why do you let your hearts trouble you, my children? Why do you let the words of the accuser trouble you into thinking there is no rapture, or that you are not good enough for my saving grace? I counsel you, my children, to continue to walk by faith and not by sight; and I am he who has made you worthy, even all who are in Christ and have a saving relationship with their righteous Lord, so doubt not! Although, you have not seen me with your physical eyes, you know full well that I am your living Lord and savior, and in me is fullness of life and deliverance. Truly, truly, he that believes on me shall neither hunger nor thirst ever again.
For I am the bread of life, and all who eat will never hunger again; and I am he from whom rivers of living waters flow in all abundance and newness of life, and he who drinks thereof shall never thirst again. But you all will be made alive in perfect health, perfect harmony, and perfect union with Yahweh, and your living Lord and savior, for I am Christ Jesus, who purchased you in my atoning blood, and you truly are priceless. And so was the priceless payment given that I offered eternally of myself as the lamb of God, and so I presented my sacrifice on your behalf as the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek and paid your ransom in my own sinless blood.
And so it is forevermore that there is no more need of sacrifice for sin, because if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling them that are unclean, sanctifies as touching the purifying of the flesh, How much more shall the blood of Christ which through the eternal Spirit offered himself without fault to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? And what the sacrifice of animals could not accomplish, my atoning blood was able to accomplish once and forevermore, as I have made atonement for the sins of mankind once and forevermore, even for all who make the choice to accept salvation in my name, for there is no other name given under heaven whereby men can be saved. So believe not their lies, for the dragon, beast, and false prophet will rise, and they will seek to unite all spurious world religions under a new banner, except Jesus Christ will not be allowed amongst them, neither in name nor in deed, and it is given to them to make war on the saints and to overcome them. Truly, truly, I have neither part nor lot with them, and I am he who will utterly destroy them, because in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.

And so now I speak to those who will come to me during Jacob’s trouble, even the tribulation saints who will come to great reward and eternal inheritance in their eternal and everlasting Lord and Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach. And so it is written as eternal truth, and so I say eternally and evermore that you are to enter in at the narrow gate: for it is the wide gate, and broad way that leads to destruction: and many there be which go in there at, Because the gate is narrow, and the way narrow that leads to life, and few there be that find it. So I command you, my little ones, to stay on the straight and narrow way and avoid the destruction of the foolish ones, even those whose names were never written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, because they love the ways of destruction, and they love unrighteousness, and strong delusion do they prefer over righteousness and truth.
For they will run to and fro, and all-out war is coming on the earth, and all-out destruction looms and is near; danger, 911 emergency alert, and the day draws ever closer and is upon you. And out of the ashes of war will they rise, and from the ashes of war will they reveal themselves to mankind yet once again, and mankind will wonder after the fallen ones in utter awe at their tricks with which they have enchanted the lost since the beginning. They will syncretize their spurious religions, and they will tell you many lies spoken from the mouths of lying spirits of antichrist, for many antichrists have gone into the world.
What is antichrist, my children? Antichrist is in opposition to Christ, the true savior and Messiah, and also in place of Christ; for I am Yeshua HaMashiach, and there is no other. And so their lies have already saturated the earth as they have prepared the masses for obedience to the unholy three, even the dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth, which is also their false prophet. But what did John write on the subject in his first letter? I have not written to you, because you know not the truth: but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Who is a liar, but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist, that denies the Father, and the Son. Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father: but he that acknowledges the Son, has the Father also.
And so it is, that I, Jesus the Nazarene, am the way, the truth, and the life; and absolutely no one comes to Yahweh except through me. I am the only door, and I am the only way to Yahweh, the great eternal God; for so Yahweh has declared and so Yahweh has arranged and decided from before the foundations of the earth in his everlasting foreknowledge and wisdom. Which of you is able to counsel Yahweh, the great eternal God? Though ten thousand times ten thousand surround his throne, he needs no counselor; and it is Yahweh, the great eternal God, who works all things after the counsel of his own will that you should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ.
So understand the coming deception that is already come over the earth. For Satan’s ministers speak in opposition to the truth, and they are shouting abroad and shouting loudly that all world religions lead to the same god no matter what faith they are from, no matter their beliefs, that all other names given by the fallen ones are true and lead to the true god, but to the dragon alone do they lead. Truly, truly I tell you, do not believe their lies, and do not even wish them godspeed who believe such foolishness. For broad is the gate to destruction, which leads to that great burning lake of fire, and Satan seeks to push as many as he can down his road to everlasting destruction, for so is his inheritance, and so is his hate for you all. Do not believe their ecumenical lies, and run from their unholy union, for the end thereof is the hottest flames of blue as burning brimstone rolls and burns forevermore, and none shall escape who are bound and cast to the fires.

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

Understand, my children, that all of their names lead to the same god, even Satan, for they are no gods but pretenders who pretend. And so they will wave their flags of diversity, and they will claim that many names lead to the same god. And on one hand they are correct because many roads lead to the god of this world, whose judgment has come and whose punishment and destruction lingers not. And on the other hand, they lie to the world and seek to entice all who will follow their destructive ways into their new society that will rise from the ashes of war that will require the mark to enter.
Take not their mark, for all who do are eternally damned and altered forevermore. And they do lie ever grievously that all names lead to the true God, even Yahweh, who is the everlasting God of Israel, because Yahweh chose Jacob for himself that you may be a peculiar people to himself. And so Satan ever seeks to counterfeit the ways of the one true God, even El Shaddai, who is the Almighty God! And so he has made many counterfeit religions that are designed to counterfeit the ways of Yahweh, the everlasting God of all eternity, and all of these counterfeit faiths end in eternal destruction for those who are so ensnared. For what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?
And so they already give blessings for all, even all religions, and they already seek to unite all religions under their banners of ecumenical compromise, for so are their ways of psychological manipulation accomplished. On one hand they present the thesis; on the other hand they present their antithesis; and out of controlled conflict they bring about their synthesis, for they do seek to synthesize all cultures, nations, and kindred and tongues into their satanic society that they may destroy all who follow their destructive ways. And so understand, that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and their good words and fair speeches are designed to appeal to human emotion and lust and false sympathy that they will brand as holiness. Understand that mankind of himself is utterly corrupt and cannot straighten his own path, and there is no good in mankind, but mankind was corrupted by the disobedience of Adam and especially by the lies and trickery of the serpent, whose head I will surely crush, for Yahweh has declared from the beginning the end of that lying snake who feeds on the dust of the earth.
So it has been, so it is, and so will it be, that there is nothing new under the sun. And as the world turns from grace to judgment, sudden calamity is about to fall, and suddenly will it be. So I counsel all who read these words to understand that these words did not find you by accident, but they are sent of Yahweh himself by way of his only begotten son, even Yeshua HaMashiach, spoken in unison by my servants the prophets. And it is me, Jesus the Nazarene, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who paid the eternal price for your salvation and the salvation of all who will yet come to eternal life in my unending and eternal love of which Yahweh created me to fulfill. I say to you the same as I have said from the beginning: that I, Jesus the Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach, am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man comes to the Father but by me; and there is no other name given on earth, ever, whereby men must be saved, and all other names no matter how convincing the counterfeit do not lead to the true God, even the Father of Lights of whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning. So understand, my little ones, that you are the lights of the world that Yahweh has fathered, even created newly in me, Christ Jesus the everlasting righteous Lord, and I have been made a life-giving spirit.
Behold, I show you a riddle that will impart wisdom to the wise and will keep the foolish and unlearned from joining those bound for destruction in their ways. Three, two, one: and of the world’s many religions there are three that dominate that will lead to a false unholy one, and the three appear as enemies and

The BITTER SWEET

many wars have they fought. Yet, of the three, two are secretly allies, and the one will use the other, and they both lead to destruction. For of the three, two will turn viciously against the one, even the holy one which they hate but of whom they are completely overcome. And so the holy one will bring judgment to the house of God first, because judgment begins at the house of God and the day of judgment has come.
Although the holy one has overcome, two of the three will turn to destroy the one, but that destruction is impossible, and the one has already obtained complete victory. But so will the deception be that two of the three will turn on the one and make false accusations in the mouths of many false witnesses, and they will make war with the saints and overcome them. And with many blasphemous lies they do overspread the earth, but the one, even the holy one of God, has already overcome them and will crush their head utterly. But the two will appear victorious over the one they seek to destroy, and of the two they will make war on the one, though their final destruction lingers not. And so the snare will be set for the world, that out of great violence and war they will synthesize themselves so that three, two, one becomes two, one, three because they will synthesize themselves into one false religion that is led by the unholy three, even the dragon, the beast from the sea, and beast from the earth, which is also their false prophet.
And so I show you the answer to my riddle of threes. The three are three dominant religions that dominate the world that now is; and of the three, only one is true, even the holy one of God; for I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am the holy one of God who has overcome the evil one and who is Lord of Lords and King of Kings. I cannot be overcome, and I am given a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus the Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach (for I am savior of Gentile and Judean alike) should every knee bow, both in heaven and in earth and even under the earth. And so two false religions appear in opposition to each other but have sought to ingratiate themselves to the one, and truly Satan has counterfeited my true church with a false whore that glorifies and worships the queen of heaven. And so they seek a false alliance and have mixed many lies into the truth, except lies and truth do not mingle: you either have a lie or you have the truth: there is no other choice.
And as my true church is taken into the heavens and the restrainer is removed, so will the counterfeit church be destroyed, and so the one is removed entirely. The two remaining religions will rise in false victory, and a false peace will they have, and a false unity will they seek to unify the lost, even offering eternal life, perfect health, and a new day will the dragon offer. And he will unite the two into a religion their fathers did not know but will appear the same because mankind is ignorant of his true past. And by this synthesis of destruction they will go to the everlasting fires, because all who join them are those who have pleasure in unrighteousness, and not only so, but those who love and believe and make and worship lies because their ways are false and perverse and their ways lead to the second death.
And so will they lead astray the world, who will wonder after them, saying, who is like the beast? And one beast will be given the power of the other beast, and the beast from the sea will rule them according to his rule, and the beast from the earth will rule the land according to his rule, and they shall rule the earth in unrighteousness. And of the two remaining, they shall synthesize as one. Except, their ways are death, and therein is the trap set, for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird? All who follow their ecumenical ways will be united, only in the inheritance of the fallen ones; and all who unite themselves through their serpent’s bite will share of the fallen one’s inheritance in that great lake of burning brimstone where they burn eternally and their worm dies not. And so their ecumenism is littered with snares that are cleverly

hidden, for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?
So I counsel all who read these words and all who have eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to understand, that salvation and eternal life and the true God, even Yahweh himself, is found in no other name except the name of the only begotten son of God, even Jesus Christ, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach; and I am the savior for all mankind, even the race of Adam of whose blood the entire race of men share fully. And in whatever tongue, and from whatever nation, all may come freely and receive my gift of eternal salvation by calling on my holy name until the end. For I am your Lord and savior, only never let my name depart from your lips, and I will save you to the uttermost.
Join not their ecumenism, for they know not what they worship, and they are enchanted by lies that will lead them to their eternal destruction. And so it is that salvation is found in no other name, and no other name has been given where mankind may be saved and that mankind may approach Yahweh, for he that has not the son has not the Father. And so I will uphold and strengthen all who call on my holy name to the end. And you will do great exploits for me, and I send you to love the Lord your God with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength and to love your neighbor as yourself and to help and love one another in the worst times that are about to break across the earth.
So three, two, one, where two will turn on the one, and the two remaining will synthesize as one and will be ruled by the unholy three, who will rule those whose names were never written in the Book of Life from before the foundations of the world. Only join them not, my saints; for it is better to lose your life that you may find it than to love your life only to lose your lives eternally in everlasting destruction. Behold! The final separation is about to start and the times are now. Fear them not, my little ones, but rely on your everlasting Lord and savior. I am an everlasting help in times of need, and I will yet save a multitude of multitudes during Jacob’s trouble, and I will yet save a remnant of Israel, and none is able to pluck you from my hands.
Understand that your hope is an eternal hope, and I have not left you hopeless, and I have left you an everlasting example. For it is written of me in Hebrews: Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne of God. And so understand that my example of obedience echoes as an example to strengthen your faith that you may endure to the end, even as I endured to the end when I said those final words on the cross: It is finished. And so God raised me from the dead because it was impossible that death should hold me, for mine is the innocent blood.
And so I have given you great hope, my little ones, even so that you may fasten your minds on the joy that is set before you because the sufferings of Jacob’s trouble do not compare nor are they worthy to be mentioned in relation to the eternal joy set before you. Behold! It is written by John the Revelator: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. They shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
And so is your hope, my loves, that you may endure to the end. And yours is an eternal hope because El

Shaddai, the Almighty God, will create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness, and you will be given access to that holy city prepared and adorned by Yahweh himself as a bride prepared for the bridegroom, and from the tree of life you will eat. And as it is written: He that overcomes, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
I, Yeshua HaMashiach, am he who has sent my words by my servant, and by my servant have my words been sent for the obedience of all who read. And I have revealed the everlasting gospel, for the times of its revealing are now.
I am he who is coming for those in Christ and will rescue the faithful in my church from the refiner’s fire and the wrath to come.
I am he who separates the wheat from the tares, and not one of you can be plucked from my hand.
Stand for me, my tribulation saints, and come to me, oh, Israel, for I am Yeshua HaMashiach, your true Messiah, and I have given you great hope and great strength. And many of you will do mighty works for me, and not one of you will go unrewarded, for even the tiniest things you do during times of great trouble bring eternal reward, of which glory your sufferings are not worthy to be mentioned; so call on my mighty name, my people! Salvation and great reward are in my hand for those who overcome, for so Yeshua HaMashiach promises for the faithful.
Behold, the times are now!

As It Is Written, So Shall It Be Done!
SEPTEMBER 7, 2024
Gather yourselves and hear the words of your Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach, my children, for I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and in righteousness will I come to judge and make war. So understand the times in which you live and events to come, and gather your ears to the sound of my voice, and hear the words of your everlasting and eternal Lord, even the resurrected and glorified Christ Jesus! I will now speak of things to come during Daniel’s seventieth week and will make your paths plain, and I will extend my saving grace at the hands of my 144,000. For they do come to save my people from destruction, and they do come to hide away my people from wrath, even the wrath of God that is intended for the fallen ones and those who attach themselves forevermore to them and their kingdom by taking their mark, even that beastly serpent’s bite of which there is no remedy.
And yet so it is that I will snatch my Bride into the heavens, and I will seal my 144,000 from the following tribes, even 12,000 from each of the following: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Nephthali, Manasses, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zabulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. So hear my voice!
And they will be an unstoppable force, even an unbreakable force will they be. For theirs are lives eternal, of which no corruption can corrupt. Theirs are bodies indestructible, for no destruction can take hold of the redeemed; for victory over death and destruction do they evermore have for all eternity. They will be re-created as children of light, and with everlasting glory will they be clothed, and they will have unique abilities and talents written into their very being that will reflect their accomplishments which comprise and embody abilities that I will create within them. For I, Christ Jesus, am the refiner who sits with billow in hand, stoking the flames of purification, that I may re-create you all newly in me, Christ Jesus your ascended Lord and Savior; and to whosoever overcomes, even they will inherit all things.
And so I give you to understand events that will shortly occur, and some events happen in succession while others happen simultaneously, and yet I will list them so you may discern the times you live, and so that you my tribulation saints are not taken prey to the strong delusion that has overshadowed the earth and of which many will be deceived and taken in judgment. For the fallen ones will show themselves and will lie many times over, and they will offer life but are powerless to offer life, and neither can they give life; but every word they speak is rooted in lies that lead to the second death, and only eternal destruction is to be found by those who follow the ways of the fallen ones and all who accept their sordid lies for truth. But so is the condemnation that has come into the world, that men love darkness rather than light and men love lies rather than the truth, because mankind has rejected me, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ, in favor of a false savior; yet the truth is in Christ alone, and all else are liars and frauds.
And so things to come are as follows, and some events occur simultaneously and others occur in succession and are needed for further events to occur. And many events are not listed but will come about in their time. And so what some call rapture, or the gathering together of all in Christ to their Lord, is the first event set to trigger all other events during Jacob’s trouble, also called Daniel’s seventieth week, for a week of seven years will it be, where each day is a year. And so the faithful in my Church, which is my Body and my Bride, will be taken when I, Christ Jesus, descend from the heavens with a shout, and with the voice of

304

the archangel and the trump of God. For the last trumpet will sound, at which time the dead in Christ will be raised to newness of life; then you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them, and it will happen even as it is written, and in the order given it will occur in the twinkling of an eye. So understand, my faithful, even those whom I love with an eternal and everlasting love, that you will suddenly and instantly find yourselves in the throne room of Yahweh himself, where I will present you without spot or wrinkle or any such things to the Father of lights, and you are the lights of the world. And instantly will you know even as you are known, and you will see me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and you will see Yahweh, the Great Eternal God, with your own eyes for the first time, and you will be utterly astounded at what you see and the glory of which you will be clothed. And forevermore will you be in everlasting union with the Father, and with the Son, and forevermore will we be.
At the times of the gathering of the saints, the restrainer will be removed, and judgment will fall fully on the house of God. And those who have allowed me to refine them in the refiner’s fire will stand because they have been purified in the blood of the lamb and will stand in the righteousness that I have given them, because I am the Righteous Lord who is a life-giving spirit. And those who refused my voice and remained stubborn to my will and refused to come out of sin into righteousness will be left to further refining during the times of Jacob’s trouble, and many multitudes will achieve eternal salvation, reward, and splendor, and forever they will live and great glory is theirs forevermore. And so also will the remaining counterfeit churches be destroyed as the Dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth will move swiftly to make war on the remaining saints and will overcome them. And so will it be.
When the restrainer is removed, Secret Babylon will be destroyed as written. Even in one hour will her fate become final, and great misery and destruction will consume the earth, and great shaking will occur, and it will be plain to the world that the day of the Lord has come, though the fallen ones will lie and present themselves as benevolent aliens, and they will endeavor to cover my appearing for the faithful in war and a fake alien invasion. So do not believe their lies, my children, for their lies are intended to lead you to eternal destruction that is reserved for the fallen ones, so join them not.
And so the seals will be loosed and the four horseman will be released on the world, and many, many people will perish as a result. And of Secret Babylon’s empire that sits on many waters, even these will be destroyed and culled, and the spoils will serve the rising and final beast system; and it is final because I, Christ Jesus, will utterly destroy and ruin Satan’s kingdom, never to rise again. And so the world will wonder after the beast, and many will join their satanic kingdom. And the evil nature in mankind, brought about by Adam’s sin when Eve took from the serpent and did eat, will be utterly unrestrained, and mankind will have full madness in their hearts, and many will forever join themselves to the beast by accepting and taking the mark of the beast. Take not his mark, because all who do will forever be cast alive into that fiery lake of brimstone, burning the hottest flames of blue.
Out of the ashes of war will their final empire rise, even from the ashes of the old order, because out of the chaos they cause will arise their new order, even the order of the Dragon. And so will they seek to unite all the world under their banner, and they will synthesize all world religions and will utterly deny me, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ, who will not be allowed among them. And truly, truly, I have never had neither part nor lot with them. And so they will move with much speed and great cruelty in their war against the saints, and the world will turn completely on the tribulation saints, and all who overcome by

calling on my name to the end will forevermore be glorified in eternal reward and everlasting splendor, and great is their reward, and those who overcome will inherit all things.
As their new society emerges, so too will my two olive trees arise, even my two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. Great power will be given them, and they will prophesy for 42 months clothed in sackcloth; and if any man will hurt them, fire will proceed out of their mouth, and devour their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These will have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and will have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And great will be the world’s hatred against them. And standing in opposition to my two olive trees will be the beast and the false prophet, and the one will point to the other, and they will glorify themselves, and many blasphemous things will they say, and many lying signs and wonders will they do in the sight of men.
These beasts will do great wonders to deceive them that dwell on the earth, for it will be permitted them to do many lying signs and wonders, and in like power will they rule. The beast from the earth will cause fire to come down on the earth in the sight of men, and he will lead all men to wonder after them with many lying signs and wonders. And he will make an image of the beast and will cause all to worship the image which he will make. And it will be permitted to him to give a spirit to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should speak and will cause that all who will not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he will make all, both rich and poor, free and slave, to receive his mark in their right hand or in their foreheads.
IF ANY MAN WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND RECEIVE HIS MARK IN HIS FOREHEAD, OR IN HIS HAND, THE SAME SHALL DRINK OF THE WINE OF THE WRATH OF GOD, WHICH IS POURED OUT WITHOUT MIXTURE INTO THE CUP OF HIS INDIGNATION, AND HE SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS, AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAMB: AND THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCENDS UP FOR EVER AND EVER. AND THEY HAVE NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT, WHO WORSHIP THE BEAST AND HIS IMAGE, AND WHOSOEVER RECEIVES THE MARK OF HIS NAME.
And during this time will their temple be built, even when animal sacrifice is no longer needed because I am the Lamb of God and I sacrificed myself for the sins of mankind as the high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Atonement has been made for the sins of mankind once, all, and forevermore in my atoning, sinless, blood. And so it is, there remains no more sacrifice for sin.
And so when my two olive trees have finished their testimony at the end of 42 months, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and will kill my two candlesticks, for so it is given him to accomplish. And their bodies will lie dead for three and a half days in the streets, even as the world celebrates and exchanges gifts over their deaths. And so will a great voice come from the heavens and say, Come up hither! And to newness of life will they be raised, and they will be received into the heavens in the sight of their enemies.
And they will complete their temple and the trap will be set, for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird? Because the beast from the earth is he who sets a trap in the land, he will lure many into his web of deceit, and he will betray the people of the land. And that man of sin will be disclosed, even the son of

perdition, Which is an adversary, and will exalt himself against all that is called God, or that is worshiped: so that he does sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. And their temple will be finished, and the abomination of desolation will be accomplished by their false Moshiach. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of the abominations; he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
And so the greatest tribulation will occur, even a tribulation that the likes have never been experienced on earth before, and truly, never will be again. Behold! I, even Yeshua HaMashiach, will not leave my people to sudden destruction, and I will yet save Israel, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as the true Messiah, for so Yahweh has created me to be. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and my 144,000 will do many mighty works for me.
For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet, and the trumpet is about to sound. These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb, which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my Bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen, and their abilities will embody their accomplishments, and great abilities will they possess; for they are faithful, called, and chosen, even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.
My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion, and I will lead them. They will take those to whom I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies’ kingdom. They will be led to safety from the seven plagues, for in these judgments is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the Dragon, for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead them to safety; they will heal them from their wounds; they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord, even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh would be left alive. And so they will complete that in which I will lead them.
And as the unholy three moves to destroy those who accept me as their Messiah, so too will the full wrath of God be fulfilled on their heads and on their kingdom in its entirety; truly, truly, the seven vials of which are filled the wrath of God; and great judgment and misery are contained in their vials, and it will happen even as it is written:
The first angel will pour out his vial upon the earth, and those who receive their unholy mark will be stricken with noisome and grievous sores by the vial of which the first angel will pour.
And the second angel will pour out his vial, and the seas will become as the blood of a dead man, and all living sea creatures will perish.
And the third angel will pour out his vial, causing the rivers and streams to be turned to blood, for they have spilled the blood of the saints and the prophets, and so it is fitting that they be given blood to drink.

Truly truly, the fourth angel will pour out his vial on the sun, and it will be given unto him to torment men with heat of fire, and men will be scorched of the heat and will speak great and blasphemous things against the God of heaven.
And the fifth angel will pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom will become increasingly dark, with great intensity, and they will gnaw their tongues for sorrow.
And the sixth angel will pour out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof will dry up, that the way of the Kings of the East should be prepared.
And the seventh angel will pour out his vial into the air: and there will come a loud voice out of the Temple of heaven from the throne, saying, It is done. And there will be voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and a great earthquake will occur, such as was not since men were upon the earth, even so mighty an earthquake. And the great city will be divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations will fall. And so will these things be.
So understand, my children, that Yahweh will hide away his own even during Jacob’s trouble, even during the great tribulation will a remnant yet be saved alive and will remain in safety in the wilderness, even a place prepared of God himself, that they should feed them there a thousand two hundred and sixty days. And no flesh would be left alive had the days not been shortened. And the fallen ones will gather themselves to do battle with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and so it is written and so will it be done.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he has on his vesture, and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.
And so my angel will descend from the heavens, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain where he will bind Satan in the bottomless pit for a thousand years and set the seal so that he should deceive the nations no more for a thousand years. At the end of my thousand-year reign, Satan will be loosed from the abyss for a little season.
Behold! Even as John the Revelator did write, so even shall it be: And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
And at the end of my thousand-year reign Satan will be loosed out of his prison for a little season to gather them together as the sand of the sea. And will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of

the sea. And they will go up on the breadth of the earth, and compass the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire will come down from God out of heaven, and devour them. And the devil that deceived them will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet will be, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
And so will come the resurrection of the unjust, for so it is written by John the Revelator: And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.
And so it is written and so will it be done, that there is a gathering together where the dead in Christ will be raised and those who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, and this will happen right before the start of Jacob’s trouble. Then at the end of Jacob’s trouble will the resurrection of the just occur, which is composed of the tribulation saints and those of the Old Testament who died in faith, having lived according to the promises. And as it is written to Daniel, so shall it be: But go your way till the end: for you shall rest, and stand in your lot at the end of the days. And so the end of the days is the culmination of Daniel’s seventieth week and at the start of my thousand-year reign.
And at the end of my thousand-year reign and after Satan is cast to his final inheritance in that ever-burning lake of fire, so will the resurrection of the unjust occur, even that great white throne judgment will occur, and whosoever’s name is not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into the lake of fire.
And so I, even Jesus the Nazarene, even the Lamb of God, even Christ Jesus, who is also the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, will come to judge and make war on the Dragon, and all his kingdom will be utterly smashed, never to rise again. And the beast and the false prophet will be cast alive into the lake of fire, and Satan will be chained with a great chain in the bottomless pit for a thousand years, and so my millennial reign will begin, and in righteousness will my rule be. Behold! I bring my Bride and a host of kings and priests with whom I will rule the earth in righteousness, and I will rule the nations with a rod of iron. So have great hope, my children, for the consummation of all things is at hand, and this seven-year period of great trouble, even Jacob’s trouble, will be followed by my righteous rule, and Yahweh will be all in all.
And so I have given you great hope, my little ones, even so that you may fasten your minds on the joy that is set before you because the sufferings of Jacob’s trouble do not compare nor are they worthy to be mentioned in relation to the eternal joy set before you. Behold! It is written by John the Revelator: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun burn them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. They shall be Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
And so is your hope, my loves, that you may endure to the end, and yours is an eternal hope, because El

Shaddai, the Almighty God, will create a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness, and you will be given access to that holy city prepared and adorned by Yahweh himself as a bride prepared for the bridegroom, and from the tree of life you will eat. And as it is written: He that overcomes, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach, and I have sent my words by my servant, and by my servant have my Words been sent.
Behold! The everlasting gospel has been revealed and sent in its proper time, and these words will be preserved, and they will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent.
Behold! Keep your watch and do not leave your posts, my people, for the times have come.

Come Fully to Your Everlasting Lord!
OCTOBER 08, 2024
Hear, hear! Hear the voice of your Lord and hear the words of Yeshua Hamashiach and bow your hearts in obedience to the will of your Lord and allow my words to comfort your souls. So I ask you a question? Are you listening? When the Son of Man comes, will I find faith on the earth? Truly, truly, I will find faith amongst my faithful that I will take away to the safety of the heavens for their faithfulness, but the vast majority of those on the earth are faithless. And so I continue to warn you my loves to depart from the sins of sinners, and come out from amongst their ways and be ye separate, lest you partake of their judgments.
Yet, so it is, that so many people disingenuously draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. On that day many will say to me Lord Lord, and I will say to them, depart from me I never knew you! Understand that it is not enough to declare me Lord from a faithless heart, but those who truly make me Lord are those who repent of and cease from their sins and seek to live righteously before me. Know you not that I, Jesus the Nazarene, would rather have your entire heart in love and commitment over the sacrifices of your lips? Yes, I would have mercy and not sacrifice, for in part it is through my mercy, the withholding of deserved wrath, that my love is shown, even the love of Yahweh the great eternal God! Yet my words of warning are heeded by those who love me and have responded in repentance to my love for them as I have revealed myself to them for their salvation. And so it is, my love is received amongst those whose hearts are soft to my voice and, indeed, to all those who love me and of whom I have instructed to learn of me even those who I lead in my ways of salvation.
Why do you let your hearts trouble you, my little ones? Have not my apostles and prophets warned against this day since the dawn of the age? Have not the prophets of old foretold of Daniel’s seventieth week coming in great judgment on the earth? Therefore, understand, you live in the days just before Jacob's trouble breaks fully across the earth and of these days many calamities, signs, miracles, wonders, and even judgments have been foretold and are now unleashed, so why do you marvel? These are the final warnings on a smaller scale of what is to come over the entire earth when my faithful are departed to me in the heavens from the earth as I gather them together as calves of the stall, and they will find absolute safety and fulfillment as they stand in their first moments born again into all eternity, where they will never perish, nor suffer, nor endure sickness, but will have perfect joy and perfect harmony with Yahweh, and indeed me Yeshua HaMashiach and great reward and inheritance will I give them, for I have their reward in my mighty hand.
So many of my faithful have become leavened by false doctrines from the prosperity gospel that is erroneously preached by false prophets and teachers who lie to my people, telling them that calamity will never touch them as long as they think happy thoughts. These wells without water preach another Jesus and they do not know me, Yeshua HaMashiach, and neither have I sent them. Always compare the words of those who claim to speak for me to scripture and where they contradict scripture is where they speak from their own hearts for their own greedy gain.
Truly, truly there are many false ministers who have sown lies amongst my congregations and the false prosperity gospel leads to the wide way of destruction where the gates of hell will open wide to those who

311

THE

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

follow to that ever burning lake of fire burning the hottest flames of cobalt blue prepared for the fallen ones and those who follow them, so do not fall for their lies! I do not speak of my faithful prophets who perhaps misspeak a word for me, nor the ones who make an honest mistake and correct themselves. Understand that none of my prophets prophecy in full, but all of my prophets prophecy in part and they will never contradict scripture when they truly speak for me, Christ Jesus, because I am the word of God made flesh who dwells amongst you, though after the flesh I am known no more.
My little ones be not deceived because always in this world there is persecution and anguish, especially now at the end of Satans kingdom as the fallen ones come into judgment and as they prepare to do what they are allowed to accomplish in their judgment because even the enemies of Yahweh obey his voice. Have you not read in Romans where I instructed Paul in my ways? Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
And so my chosen have always suffered many things for my name’s sake and there has been a huge multitude of martyrs in my age of grace who have given their lives in service in furtherance of the gospel of salvation, even the very gospel that has saved your souls by faith in Jesus the Nazarene because in part it was through the work of my martyrs the gospel of salvation saturated the earth. Yet, many of you have been leavened by the leaven of various name it and claim it false doctrines that have saturated my Laodicean Church.
These evil doctrines are not of me and your thoughts do not accomplish anything outside of yourselves unless you speak my words on lips of faith when I grant signs, miracles, and wonders to be done by your hands. So you cannot imagine yourselves out of distresses and persecution, nor are my called, chosen and faithful exempt from calamity. Where ever in the Word of God does it say that whosoever believes on me will never suffer tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? On the contrary some or even all of these are guaranteed to all who live faithfully for me, and so I counsel you to repudiate their words because their words are cleverly devised fables sent by the fallen ones to overthrow the very faith of the elect should such a thing be possible. However, understand that all of my faithful ones who follow me with their entire heart are saved from the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of God and they will be taken to safety in the throne room of Yahweh before judgment fully falls on the earth.
And so it is my children that many of you will suffer various calamities and persecutions brought about by the fallen ones and many will lose this world’s gain in this finality before I gather my faithful. With each passing second, my appearing is that much closer. So I encourage you, my loves, to stand for me and hold fast to my love as your motivating force to endure what is needed for you to bring salvation to the lost as you lead them onto the Ark before calamity strikes.
Understand what I gave Paul to write to the Colossians: Now I rejoice in my sufferings which I suffer for you, and fulfill that which is behind of the passions of Christ in my flesh for his bodies’ sake, which is the congregation, whereof I am made a minister according to the ordinance of God, which ordinance was given me to you, to fulfill the word of God. So it is, my loves, that when you suffer for my namesake, then

312

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

you continue in and partake of my sufferings that I endured on Calvary. While, I left nothing undone in your salvation, and I am the complete and perfect Passover for all time, I have called each of you to endure many things for my namesake, so count it all joy! And know my children that eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the hearts of men the things that God has prepared for them that love him. So run, run that you may obtain! For God is not unrighteous, that he should forget your work, and labor of love, which you showed toward his Name, in that you have ministered to the Saints, and yet minister.
So many of you who have been led astray in your expectations that you no longer realize that many times my called, chosen, and faithful willingly endure hardships, humiliation, loss, and much, much more and the end result of their endurance in the sufferings of Christ is salvation to the lost and great reward and recompense for those who sacrifice themselves in such manner. Have you not read in Acts where Paul and Silas endured much hardship in Macedonia, being beaten severely and unjustly cast into prison and made fast in the stocks at Philippi?
Yet I sent an earthquake to deliver them out of their bonds, and so the Philippian jailer and his household achieved salvation through the endurance of Paul and Silas. And for many of those who follow me, they will endure hardships and persecution and tribulation. But in all of these things you are more than conquerors and I do fight for you my children, if you but remain obedient to my voice and follow my will with your entire heart and I will cause you to overcome all things if you but remain faithful to my voice and allow me to direct your steps, for your salvation is in obedience to your everlasting savior.
And so I counsel you, my loves, to stand for me and give my love to a dying and convicted world that stands in chains as judgment is about to fully fall. Will you allow me to help you overcome discouragement so that you hold your hope in mind? Have you forgotten my words, my loves? And now abides faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love. And so I send you to love the lost, because it is the goodness of God that leads people to repentance many times. Therefore, serve me in your communities, pray for those who have lost everything because while they still draw breath it may be that the loss of this world will cause them to gain all eternity. Preach to the sinners and bring salvation to the lost and remember you are my ambassadors my loves and fulfill your calling in me and remain steadfast in this finality of times. So I send you to love your neighbors and to provide sustenance and help to those in need. Even a drink of water or a plate of food, give whatever you can to help those who suffer doubting nothing. And if you happen to suffer alongside the lost then love them fully and show my testimony and power and speak for me on lips of believing from a heart filled with faith, hope, and love!
And so I ask you, are you afraid to help sinners? Do you not understand that when I was sent not but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel that I spent my time with publicans and sinners? Have you forgotten that you were once living lives of habitual sin? Have you forgotten that I am the only sinless man even the lamb of God? So let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom I have ransomed from the hand of the enemy. Love, love, love until your last breath for it is better to die serving in the love of Christ than to shrink in fear at the pathetic efforts of the weak and beggarly elements, of which I have overcome fully and given victory to all who make me their everlasting Lord. So love not your lives to the end and follow my example of fearless service in the face of evil and death that have been overcome fully by the everlasting love of the great eternal God, even El Shaddai!
Fear not, for I am with you: be not afraid, for I am your God: I will strengthen you, and help you, and will

sustain you with the right hand of my justice. So come to me my children and rest in my love for you and I will soothe your souls and heal your wounds and I will strengthen you in your brokenness that you may have to give to those who need you for so are you sent. Because it is you my ambassadors who are not only chosen and called to the glory of my Kingdom, but also to suffer for my namesake.
Truly, truly, you are partakers of my sufferings, only follow my example and faint not in your hour of despair. For I am with you every step of the way, and it is I, the Lord Jesus Christ who purifies your souls in my refiners fire, though you are but earthen vessels in the potters hands, the purifying fires will cause your face to be set like a flint so that you are unbreakable in my strength and yet still in the weakness of your flesh. Yet, so it is that in the weakness of sinful flesh is my love perfected in you as I draw you closer to me and prepare you further for your eternal purposes. Therefore, it is a just thing for the redeemed to suffer for my namesake because I gave my entire being in agonizing sacrifice that you may live before Yahweh, even the great almighty God. Understand that in your trials and sufferings you are not only bringing my saving grace to those in need but also working out your own salvation in fear and trembling that I may bring you to your full reward and so is your hope about to be realized!
Perhaps you have heard of the endurance of Job? How that Job was a faithful man who came to hard times and who was unjustly attacked by Satan. Perhaps you have heard of the end of Job because Job was not an unrighteous man who was overcome of evil, but a righteous man who found mercy who overcame evil with good by following the words of Yahweh and remaining in righteousness even in the face of evil persecution. And so Yahweh restored to Job double of all that was unjustly taken from him, and Yahweh recompensed Job for his troubles and persecution. Behold, we count them blessed which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have known what end the Lord made. For the Lord is very pitiful and merciful.
And so remains faith, hope, and love, and the greatest of these is love. So understand my loves that for the faithful hope is about to be fully realized as you are snatched to the safety of the heavens from the coming judgments. Hear my voice and understand my love for you my called, faithful, and chosen, even my body and even my bride! Therefore, rest in my love because even in the greatest adversity my love remains strong and unconquerable because I am one in unity and purpose with my Father, and it is Yahweh’s eternal love that I give to all who are heirs of eternal life and all who come to Jesus the Nazarene for salvation.
Understand no man can come to Yahweh except through me, Christ Jesus. And so it is that Yahweh’s love is unconquerable because Yahweh is unconquerable, and therefore I am unconquerable, for I have overcome. And I am the everlasting Lord of salvation, even he whom Yahweh has made Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and he has given me a name greater than any name that at the name of Jesus Christ should every knee bow in heaven and earth and under the earth. Understand that the fallen ones fear you my loves and great fear grips their hearts on account of their impending judgment that lingers not.
I command and encourage you, my children, to take my love to this sick and dying and judged world in this last time before calamity fully falls. I say to you heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons for he that believes on me the works that I did on earth so too shall he do and greater works in deed because I have gone to our Father. Walk out in great love and humility, and meet those who are in need with the power of Christ that I will energize mightily in you. For it is in you, my earthen vessels, that the power of the excellency of God in Christ in you resides. Speak to the problems you face in faith. Have faith in Yahweh, and faith in Yeshua HaMashiach and say to that mountain REMOVE AND BE CAST

Be bold and courageous, for I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who fights for you. I implore you and constrain you by the love of God that is in Christ Jesus your Lord to willingly endure for my namesake and bring the lost home to our Father even in this last time. I implore you my chosen set the example for you are my faithful and chosen whom I have forged in affliction that in the weakness and brokenness of your flesh you might manifest the power of the great eternal God, even Yahweh himself as you go in service and great authority to those I send you to serve.
I am with you every step of the way
I am one in unity and purpose with my Father

Rest in my love and rest in my works, having ceased from your own and now is the time of your redemption and now is the time of your full salvation, and I am coming for you my loves. Hear me and hear my words, I will not leave you nor forsake you my faithful ones in Christ, even all those who are obedient to my voice. Look to the skies, for my appearing is about to break across the skies at a time and hour you least expect. I am coming for you my faithful, are you ready?

To My Faithful who Patiently Wait on Your Everlasting Lord!
OCTOBER 13, 2024
Hear the words of your eternal Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach and come to me with your hearts ready to receive and expect your reward from my hand, for truly the time is now. Even that long expected moment when I descend from the heavens with a mighty shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God (for that trumpet will sound) and the dead in Christ will be raised incorruptible and you which are alive and remain shall be caught up in the clouds where you will put on immortality and so will you ever be with, and like, your everlasting Lord forevermore.
I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and I am he who has purchased the earth in my atoning blood. Truly, truly, I paid the price for the sins of mankind that mankind might be reconciled to Yahweh, because I, Jesus the Nazarene am your peace treaty whereby men are reconciled to God, wherefore I had Paul write to the Corinthians: Now then are we ambassadors for Christ: as though God did beseech you through us, we pray you in Christs stead, that you be reconciled to God. For he has made him to be sin for us, which knew no sin, that we should be made the righteousness of God in him.
Therefore, my children, I have made you the righteousness of God by way of Christ in you the hope of glory, even that spirit of everlasting sonship whereby you cry ABBA, Father and so you are born again as eternal sons of God and are sealed with that holy spirit of promise. Understand that the seal of Yahweh cannot be broken, nor altered, and all those who are sealed thereby are eternally secure, and so understand that what Yahweh has written and declared that no one can change. So who is it that can pluck you from my hands? Who is it that can overcome the great eternal God, even Yahweh, who is the Father of Lights? So why do you fret and worry that I will cast you away? Yet, which of you would cast your own children away, as if such a thing is a light matter in the sight of your Lord and Savior, even Jesus the Nazarene.
Truly, truly, the gifts and calling of God are without repentance and those who have been given the gift of eternal life by confessing Jesus as Lord all the while trusting that God raised me from the dead are given eternal life and are made the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus their Lord. Now if any man makes that confession from a faithless heart I withhold the seal of the living God that I may draw them fully to myself so they come to full repentance of sins, lest perhaps my seed has fallen on stony ground. Now if any man has not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. I am he who tests and tries the hearts of men that they may be purified in my fires of purification because I am he who sits with billow in hand stoking the flames of purification for I am the smith who billows the coals that you may come to your full inheritance in me, Christ Jesus, so stay meek to my efforts and resist not the pull of that spirit of sonship born within you that brings righteousness and true holiness. And so I implore you my children walk after the spirit that you fulfill not the lusts of the flesh.
Yet, so many of you let your hearts trouble you needlessly that the seal of God can be broken by the folly of man. I ask you, my loves? Did El Shaddai in his foreknowledge overlook the fact that he was sending me, Jesus the Nazarene, to redeem sinners who would sin again after salvation? Did Yahweh, the great eternal God who needs no counselor though ten thousand times ten thousand surround his throne, and who works all things after the counsel of his own will not understand the imperfection of corrupted Adam, even

The BITTER SWEET

all men born of red earth who partake of Adam’s blood?
No my children, it is impossible that Yahweh would not understand these things and has provided for you in every way and given every means in order for your full redemption to come fully on you my loves. So walk in the law of faith and by means of my spirit born within you and walk according to the spirit of life in Christ Jesus. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace shall be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Do you not understand that the just shall live by faith? So understand that none of my faithful are perfect at this time, no, not until their full redemption. And all the redeemed who are sealed with that holy spirit of promise will all sin, either knowingly or unknowingly, throughout the day. Therefore, cleanse yourselves in my atoning blood daily. Come to me and kindle your relationship with me and keep it strong, my loves. Confess your sins to me daily, and remain meek to my still small voice when I come to you to convict you of righteousness. I have already moved towards you and am right there in front of you cheering you onwards and keeping your paths clear so that you may walk that straight and narrow path of which you have been called to walk. And continue to look forward to that day of your full redemption where you will stand perfect before Yahweh himself clothed in the righteousness that I will fully give you for it is I, Christ Jesus, who will clothe you in spotless, fine white linen without spot, blemish, nor wrinkle or any such thing.
Therefore, understand my little ones, that judgment has come on the earth, even that great judgment foretold of old by the prophets of old even whose time for fulfillment has now come. The birth pangs are non-stop on the earth now as judgment is here and my redeemed will come to their full redemption. And so it is that events will come, wave by wave. Each wave greater and more intense in its destruction than the last until suddenly you are taken to safety and suddenly Secret Babylon is not. Each wave brings judgment and each wave crashes harder and louder than the last. And so are my judgments and warnings to the earth, for I do come as the lion of the tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.
And so it is that before the final calamity strikes it will happen at my command that my faithful ones who have fallen asleep in Christ will be raised from their graves and my faithful ones who are alive and remain will be gathered with them and into the heaven of the heavens you will go, where you will all stand before that great judgment-seat of Christ that you all may receive for the things done in the body. All who are taken to approach my Bema do not come there to be judged on account of their sins because you accepted remission of sins during the day of sinful man even in this day when sinful man rules the earth of which rule is at its end. Because the earth belongs to me, Christ Jesus, and the fullness thereof, and I am approaching and I will take by force my inheritance from the squatters and their full judgment lingers not. My loves, understand that you have passed from death straight to eternal life in me, Christ Jesus your Lord. And I am he who has cleansed you fully from sin in my atoning blood because I am your perfect Passover who has offered myself to Yahweh the great eternal God, once, all, and forevermore for the sins of mankind: therefore, there remains no more sacrifice for sins.
Therefore, the sons of God will approach my judgment seat that I may judge their works so that all will receive for what they have accomplished, whether it be good or bad. And so you all will bring the sacrifices of your redeemed lives on earth you have offered in service to your eternal Lord. As it is written, so will it be done, just as written: For other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

And if any man build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, timber, hay, or stubble, Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by the fire: and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work, that he has built upon, abide, he shall receive wages. If any man’s work burn, he shall endure loss, but he shall be saved himself: nevertheless yet as it were by the fire.
So it will be my loves that I will reward you fully for your service to me and the things that are burned away as chaff by my fires of judgment you will suffer loss and for those things that withstand my fires of judgment, even the works that I have given you to accomplish, great reward will be yours. For it is written: Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him. And so is the nature of your inheritance and reward, that not one man on earth understands fully the magnificence and glory of the inheritance of the eternal sons of God who are born again after the spirit of Christ, whereby you are born again sons of God for all eternity.
So understand my loves that the day of your full redemption is closer than you imagine, and it is speeding towards you right this very second and that day is soon to be fulfilled, sooner than you expect. Understand that there is no more time remaining to warn, no more time remaining to plead, no more time remaining to reason with secret Babylon because her judgment is final and cannot be altered. No, her times of repentance were wasted, and she ignored fully the voices of my prophets and apostles saying in her heart as she scoffed at my words “I sit as a queen and am no widow, tomorrow will be as today and today is the same as yesterday.”
Yet in one hour will her calamity fall fully on her, and never again will she rise. But in place of a once great nation that respected the ways of Yahweh and where people followed Jesus the Nazarene and were not ashamed to love their neighbors will a wasteland remain where Secret Babylon will be laid waste in one hour because strong is the Lord God which judges her. And as that calamity approaches ever closer my loves, so too does your full redemption, salvation, reward, and eternal joy, so fret not at the approaching judgment of sinners that is not for you if you come fully out of your sins.
And so that twinkling of an eye approaches where in a split second you will find yourselves standing in the throne room of Yahweh himself where your thrones are adorned and where you are seated as eternal kings and priests by the inheritance of your eternal Lord, whereby you shall rule the nations with a rod of iron for so is given to me, and so will I give to those who overcome. Who are my overcomers? Even those who came fully out of sin by full repentance and repudiation of their sins. And it is I Christ Jesus who has overcome the wiles of the devil fully and for all eternity, leaving him a desolate and fully defeated enemy of which the eternal flames of punishment are stoked and ready to receive, for so is their inheritance and so are they worthy.
Therefore, I have paved a mighty way for all who come to me fully to overcome fully the wiles of the devil in like manner as I did. So come to me fully that I may lead you on that straight and narrow path to your full salvation. Hear my voice those of you who have slipped and fallen in the way for a just man falls seven times, and rises again, so rise up Oh’ men of God and come to me fully that I may reconnect you to your reward by cleansing you in my atoning blood that you may stand fully clothed in my righteousness. Understand that my overcomers will inherit all things and no good thing will be withheld from them. And so my overcomers, will forever shine, even as the brightness of the firmament: and you who have turned many to

righteousness, will shine as the stars, for ever and ever. So now knowing this my children that now is time to leave the cares of this world and rest in me and stay pure as a virgin in my atoning blood.
Therefore, my loves stand fast in the face of approaching calamity, because you do see that terrible day approaching, and I am he who has opened the eyes of the humble in heart that you may see the truth of your world and not succumb to strong delusion that is not for you. Understand that I, Yeshua Hamashiach am the one who causes the blind to see, therefore, come to me that I may anoint your eyes with eye salve and that you may see in part this wicked world as it truly is in which you live. So fear not the judgment of sinners for that judgment is not for you my loves, no judgment is not for the redeemed because you have been saved from the wrath of the Lamb and from the wrath of God, wherefore stand fast and secure in your salvation my loves because the day is at hand and is speeding towards you ever closer by the second.
Yes that moment in time of your full redemption has come upon you my loves and that everlasting moment of time is nearly here and is coming upon you nearer and nearer by the second. I have confirmed in your spirits, I have shown signs above and signs in the earth, I have caused wonders in the heavens and even unleashed disasters in judgment on sinners and to wake those who slumber that they may understand that now is the time for full redemption of the children of the Almighty God, even my bride and my body.
Do not join them in their faithless ways, because they seek to take claim and explain away the many signs and wonders that are shown in the heavens of which many have been drawn with the finger of Yahweh himself. Have you forgotten Genesis my loves? For it is written: And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years. And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. Therefore, understand that Yahweh reigns supreme and there is nothing that is allowed on his creation that he does not allow, and of which he is not aware. Wherefore, do not join them in their faithless reasonings that mankind now somehow controls and manipulates the heavens, although mankind certainly tries to overcome God and his efforts always end in futility.
Yet, the fallen ones do try to hide my signs and the many announcements that Yahweh has placed in the heavens of the wedding of the bridegroom to his bride. So take comfort in the glory of God, knowing that whatever the fallen ones are allowed to do only serves the eternal purposes of the everlasting God for so are his ways that even his enemies obey his voice. But make no mistake Yahweh reigns supreme and nothing occurs of which he does not allow in his grace, mercy, and eventual eternal judgment on the unrepentant and fallen ones. Even that great judgment foretold of old that is now about to break across the earth in violent fashion.
And that day is upon you my loves and I AM COMING FOR YOU! Though the squatters would seek to hide my glory, I will not share my glory with another and so the weak and beggarly elements efforts are futile to conceal the appearing of Christ Jesus for my bride and my body. No, I cannot be hindered nor concealed in the least and all the world will know of my appearing, though the fallen ones will seek to conceal my appearing through war and their fake alien invasion. Understand there are no aliens from other falsely spinning worlds but fallen ones banned from the heavens forevermore who pretend because they are all pretenders who come to deceive and lead astray.
Understand that my appearing is not the same as my second coming and is a mystery concealed within the great mystery of God that I, Yeshua HaMashiach, revealed to my apostle Paul. My second coming has been

319

THE

The BITTER SWEET

known and anticipated for ages now and with it comes the resurrection of the just. At my appearing I come to gather my saints to myself that I may reward them and wed my bride and sup with my honored guests. It is at my appearing that I will snatch away to myself the faithful who have come to me in full repentance and take them to the safety of the heavens until judgment on earth has passed, for the times of judgment has come upon the entire world and especially the fallen ones.
Understand that my second coming is where I come with my redeemed and with my 144,000, and the entire host of heaven to destroy Satans kingdom fully of which destruction his kingdom will never recover. And at my second coming all will see and all will know and there is no deception that could possibly deceive anyone from this event. Satan is no king and the fallen ones are no gods but pretenders who pretend. And Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss for a thousand years that he may deceive the nations no more and until he is released for his little season and there will he remain chained in a great chain in torment and terrible fear of his inheritance in that burning lake of fire and brimstone of which he will never escape. And after his little season he will be cast fully into that ever burning lake of putrid burning brimstone that burns the hottest flames of blue. And so then will the great white throne judgment occur, even surely before Yahweh creates a new heaven and earth, and makes all things new in eternal and perfect consummation.
And so it is written and so shall it be so soon accomplished that I will descend from the heavens with a mighty shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and that mighty trumpet blast lingers not and it is the last trumpet of my age of grace as the world turns to face it’s impending and severe judgment. And I will gather my elect from the four corners of the earth, even all those who have fallen asleep in Christ, yes all who have fallen asleep in Christ sealed with that holy spirit of promise. And the birth pangs which are non-stop will give way to the earth giving birth to those who have fallen asleep, but of whom it is impossible that death should hold one second longer. And then you which are alive and remain shall be caught up in the air with them to meet me in the clouds and in the twinkling of an eye you will see.
Yes, you will see with your own eyes the everlasting glory of the great eternal God, even the Father of Lights who longs for your presence and who has prepared for this moment for all eternity because you have ever been in Yahweh’s heart. And you will see me, your eternal and everlasting Savior who gave myself fully in agony as I sacrificed myself that you may live before the Father of Lights who has fathered the lights of the world. Yes, you will see me with your own eyes, even all of you who have faith in your glorified Lord of whom you haven’t yet seen with your own eyes.
You will see with your own eyes my full glory that Yahweh has given in my inheritance of which I will share fully with my overcomers and of which I will reward all who come to me with works that withstand the fires test. Truly, truly, you will see with your own eyes the heavenly host, of whom many have been sent to minister to those who are heirs of eternal salvation. And you will stand in complete wholeness, even newly recreated in heavenly perfection and you will absolutely stand and marvel at what your eternal end will bring and what the riches of the glory of my inheritance in the saints truly means for you.
Understand my loves, (even all those who love not your lives to the end) even you who have come out of your sins in full repentance: Your eternal end is your eternal beginning where you will stand in your first second of eternal life and nothing will ever corrupt you again in the least. For you will be recreated perfect

in holy perfection and you will never be corrupted again for you will be recreated incorruptible.
And forevermore will you serve Yahweh, and forevermore will you be with me where ever I go. And I will restore to you all that the locust have eaten and all that Satan has stolen from you. You will be recompensed fully for your works and labor of love that you have showed to my name in that you have ministered to the saints and do minister. We will eat of the fat of the land during my millennial reign where you will rule with me as my kings and priests and a righteous rule will it be forevermore.
I am he who has cleansed you fully from sin in my atoning blood
I am your perfect Passover who has offered my self to Yahweh the great eternal God
I am he who has opened the eyes of the humble in heart
I am the smith who billows the coals that you may come to your full inheritance in me, Christ Jesus
I am sent by the great I AM and I AM COMING FOR YOU!
I am he who has sent my words by my servant that I have raised from his youth and set apart for my purposes and hidden in my quiver for such a time as this and by my servant have my eternal words been sent. And the words of the everlasting gospel will be preserved through the coming calamities and will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those they are sent because I, Yeshua HaMashiach, even Christ Jesus do declare these things with the full authority and power of Yahweh himself who has shared his throne with his only begotten son that by my mighty hand the creation may be restored forever more to it’s creator who is blessed forevermore, yea and Amen.

To the Faithful in Christ Jesus!
OCTOBER 25, 2024
Hearken to the voice of your Everlasting lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach, because I am he who has called you to glory and virtue by way of the new birth whereby you are sealed with my holy spirit of promise. Yes, I have made you children of the great eternal God, even Yahweh himself, and there is none like him! Therefore, understand, my loves that you are among those who I have sealed against that day of redemption whereby you will stand fully in the righteousness that I will clothe you and much reward will many carry away for their faithfulness, though some will suffer loss.
Continue to follow hard toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, and so that you may realize your full reward for the courses I have set your feet, even the courses of service where I have ordered your steps in service to me on earth during my times of grace. And you are my workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained, that you should walk in them.
And so it truly is, my loves, that I am he who has given you an eternal purpose in me, your eternal Lord. I am he who is in perfect unity and purpose with Yahweh, even the great I AM, so if God be for you, my loves, who is it that can stand against you? Why do you yield and submit your focus to the weak and beggarly elements who seek to draw you astray from my mighty eternal hand, of which drawing away is impossible if you keep the singleness of your eye focused on me, Christ Jesus your ascended Lord!
And so I still teach to this day for the obedience of all with ears to hear to lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through, and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye: If therefore your eye be single, then your whole body shall be full of light.
My loves, do you not understand my parable? Your treasures are your thoughts, and so I direct you to keep your thoughts on things above so that in your walk you are producing and walking in the good works that I have ordained for your feet to follow with singleness of heart. Therefore, I had Paul write to Corinth: But I fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
Therefore, set your affections on things which are above, and not on things which are on the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Me in God. When I, Christ Jesus, which is your life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with me in glory. Wherefore, my loves, understand that you are the lights of the world, even all those who are children of the Father of Lights! Therefore, keep your full focus on me, your eternal Lord of Lords and King of Kings and I will work mightily in your spirit that my eternal light my shine from my body of which you are part, and so my earthen vessels do shine and show the glory of the everlasting God in the face of Jesus Christ!
And so I ask you my bride, and so I ask you my body, and so I ask my faithful in Christ, why do you allow your enemies to distract and divide your attention from my glory and splendor? Understand that the fallen ones understand fully that your full redemption is as near as your next breath, and so they seek to steal your joy because they know it is impossible to pluck you from my eternal hands, though they try.

Therefore, in nothing fear your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. Do not divert your attention to the clamor of the fallen ones, my loves, neither turn to the right nor to the left. But remain on that straight and narrow way, even the way of salvation whereby you learn of me Jesus the Nazarene for I am he who teaches you the ways of salvation whereby you are saved to the uttermost as you are cleansed in my atoning blood from all sin that you may live the righteousness of God in Christ in you the hope of glory!
Understand that as you walk for me, Satan does attack you as he seeks to halt your efforts and divert you into his counterfeit works of futility. Even the counterfeit social gospel that ignores repentance and remission of sins in favor of good works. Yet so it is, that feeding the hungry, that clothing the naked, that housing the homeless and much more are good works suitable to meet the needs at hand.
But I, the Lamb of God did not offer myself once, all, and forevermore as the final sacrifice for sin on that rugged stake at Calvary to pay for good works, nor did Yahweh raise me from the dead to be a provider of this worlds goods to those in need, but I was hung on a tree and shed my last drop of blood in bitter agony in substitution and payment for sin and for the consequences of the sins of sinners.
I, Christ Jesus, have redeemed you from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for you, (for it is written, cursed is every one that hangs on a tree) and yet that was even a price that was not mine to pay, because I, Jesus the Nazarene, am he whose innocence stands to this day! And I am sinless for all times and forevermore because I always do my Father’s will. Therefore, rest in the works that I have given you to do and take my yoke upon you fully, for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
Times of great judgment have come upon the entire world, even the times of Jacob’s trouble. Yet before Jacob’s trouble comes fully on the world it must needs be that my faithful will be snatched away from the wrath to come and I, Christ Jesus, am he who is coming in the clouds with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and you which are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds with them and into the throne room of Yahweh your everlasting Father you will now go.
And so the day is upon you, my children, even all those who are faithful in Christ Jesus. Therefore, leave the cares of this fallen world behind and focus your full attention fully on your everlasting Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach. Yes, your full undivided attention because the devil seeks those who he may devour and as a roaring lion he goes about with his worthless roar but understand that he is a defeated enemy my loves because I have fully defeated him and full victory is fully mine right since my last words uttered in the flesh on that rugged stake: It is finished!
And so it is that I now move fully for your full redemption and I will complete that perfect work within each and every one of you where you will be instantly and fully recreated as a new and perfect and sinless creation. Even a perfect creation of which corruption can never corrupt, of whose glory shall never cease, and of whose brightness shall never fade. For you will be made like me, Christ Jesus, for I am the last Adam, and I am a life giving spirit who is also the captain of your salvation.
Therefore, mind the things of the spirit! Do not allow the fiery darts of the wicked to burn their way into your treasures. Understand that Satan would seek to destroy your single-minded focus on your everlasting Lord with his own worthless and putrid treasures that are many times a convincing counterfeit of the

genuine. So refuse his thoughts and ideas and repudiate all of his rebellious ways for his are the ways of death and surely he seeks to share his inheritance in those hottest flames of putrid brimstone with any who choose that eternal lake of fire, but that end is impossible for you my loves and I have sealed you eternally with the everlasting seal of the living God.
So remain in me that I may make your paths plain, and that I may show you plainly the traps Satan would seek to ensnare my faithful. Remain in me, my loves, for in Christ no trap can be set and the fowler’s snare can be set neither by craft nor by force. Wherefore, guard your thoughts and keep your heads and hearts saturated in my holy Words! (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness, which are in the high places. For this cause take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast.
Yes, stand fast in your everlasting Lord my little ones because the times are on you. Even though many of you seek to return to a state of slumber, even as this world’s falsely soothing frequencies seek to lull you into the great deception. Do not fall for their enchantments, and turn away from their witchcraft and spells. Turn away from their so-called entertainment, because it is not proper that the holy children of the most high God who belong fully to Christ Jesus be entertained by sin any longer.
I have confirmed in my faithful the nearness and absolute reality of my approaching appearing to gather my faithful into the safety of the heavens. I have even given dreams, visions, and many words to the little children who are greatly loved. My loves, this event is hurling itself fully your way and is upon you and closer than you let yourself imagine. Therefore ready yourselves for me. Continue to come out of all sin and confess your sins to me fully and confess your faults one to another.
I have sealed my faithful in that holy spirit of promise and so I have provided oil for your lamps, even all those who have freely received from me my eternal gift of salvation and eternal life and eternal inheritance in Christ Jesus the eternal Lord of Lords and King of Kings! Look to the heavens my loves and for those who are obediently and faithfully watching for my appearing they will see with their eyes the glory of my appearing, because this thing will not be done in secret and it is impossible for Satan to hide the glory of my appearing, though he will lie and seek to cover my appearing with fake aliens and world war.
Therefore, wait patiently for me and fully carry out the works that I have given you to finish that you may finish fully your courses of service in my eternal plan of salvation for each of your lives. Understand my loves that Yahweh’s justice and reward and inheritance and wages are not reckoned as natural man reckons because natural man is unrighteous and unjust. Each of you have been given works to produce that you may further my purposes of salvation and I, Christ Jesus will judge your works that you have worked in sacrifice and service to your everlasting Lord.
Understand that you all will be rewarded greatly for your faithful works of service that you have faithfully worked in my holy name. And, I, Christ Jesus am he who sees every work carried out by the faithful in Christ and the hearts intent and I will reward you to the uttermost. As I beheld the rich men casting their

The BITTER SWEET

gifts into the treasury I saw the rich men, which cast their gifts into the treasury. And I saw also a certain poor widow which cast in thither two mites: And I said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow has cast in more then they all.
And so I come to you my loves, even here in these last fleeting moments before I gather you to myself and I encourage you all by the eternal love of Yahweh himself to stand fast and look to the skies for your redemption is upon you. And each wave of calamity will increase in intensity and destruction will increase as each wave crashes across the earth. The birth pangs are non-stop now and the earth is to be delivered of her child for in the earth are the sons of Adam who have now become sons of God even by way of the last Adam. And suddenly will they all be changed eternally and forevermore into the glorious liberty of perfection and they will be clothed forevermore in eternal and everlasting glory and they do have an eternal future and an eternal purpose in Yahweh’s eternal plans.
Understand that that great red dragon is allowed to set the stage and moves his pieces into place on the worlds board. Understand that events are already in play and that the current course of the world is unsustainable and will absolutely result in utter and sudden calamity and many of these events that are aligning will come together in perfect convergence.
For so is the timing of Yahweh’s plans, and every Yod and thorn of a Yod will come together in perfect execution and harmony, for anything that Yahweh sets his hand results in eternal perfection and eternal righteousness because even those who choose corruption and the eternal flames of punishment are righteously and perfectly judged and sentenced.
And so I say my loves, keep your wicks trimmed and maintain yourselves at the highest purity in my righteous and cleansing atoning blood. Keep your wicks trimmed by keeping yourselves in the purity of thought that my eternal scripture brings for the eternal God, even Yahweh himself is he who has sent his Word and healed them.
I am he who has called you to glory and virtue
I am he who has given you an everlasting purpose in me, your eternal Lord
I am he who is in perfect unity and purpose with Yahweh, even the great I AM
I am he who teaches you the ways of salvation whereby you are saved to the uttermost
I am sinless for all times and forevermore because I always do my Father’s will
I am the last Adam
I am a life giving spirit who is also the captain of your salvation.
And I am he who sends the words of my everlasting gospel by my messenger who I have raised and commissioned for this very purpose and by my messenger have the words of my everlasting gospel been sent.
Truly, truly, I am he whom Yahweh has shared his throne until my enemies be made my footstool, even until I hand the fully redeemed creation back into the hands of the everlasting God of righteousness, that truly Yahweh may be all in all and that all may be yea and amen.
And it is I, Yeshua HaMashiach who has sent the words of the everlasting gospel for the obedience of

all who are heirs of eternal life and these words will be preserved through the coming calamities and judgments and these words will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those they are sent. Surely, I come quickly. Amen. The grace of the eternal Lord Jesus Christ is abundantly poured out over all of the faithful in Christ, AMEN and Amen.

The Time Has Come for Fulfillment: Yea and Amen!
OCTOBER 29, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach: The one who Moses commanded Israel to hearken and obey.
Incline your ears to hear the words of Yeshua HaMashiach in this last time, and bow your hearts in obedience and allow your hearts to receive my instruction. Because my words are life to those who find them and health and promise do they bring, even in times of great distress. So understand that great distress has arrived and calamity approaches, and the times are now. Truly, truly of an eternal truth it is I, Yeshua HaMashiach, even the lion of the tribe of Judah who does come to judge and make war, and understand that there is nothing hidden from my sight, neither is anything hidden in Yahweh’s sight and I see the injustice and genocide committed on the people of the land by the invaders from the synagogue of Satan and I will repay says the Righteous Lord!
For of a truth, for many jubilees the fallen ones have advanced their mystery of iniquity, even into the times of now where their schemes are ready to come to full completion. But understand that they are only allowed to fulfill Yahweh’s purposes in his everlasting and eternal plans of salvation for mankind’s full redemption. Because natural man has been lulled to sleep in great deception and great complacency.
And so the fallen ones use mankind to advance mankind’s own destruction all the while calling light darkness and darkness light. And so also is the synagogue of Satan who have invaded the lands of promise and I will root them out fully. For the Synagogue of Satan seeks to lay claim to the promises of Yahweh that are written and confirmed to the Fathers of old. The synagogue of Satan is infested with evil tares that the fallen ones have planted amongst my wheat and the times of their rooting out has come and so it is written and so shall it be done: For behold, the day comes that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that comes, shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, and shall leave them neither root nor branch.
Yet, so has it been accomplished by the fallen ones that the spider has woven his web worldwide now, and by deception they do war. And now is the time of their rising and their short unholy rule is at hand. Because Yahweh in his justice will give natural man exactly what he so foolishly desires in his pursuit of the pleasures of sin. And so the darkness and evil that natural man desires natural man will now have. Yet, if my Gospel is hidden, it is hidden to them that are lost. In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine unto them. And so natural man in his ignorance has joined the spider in its deception, for by deception they do war.
Therefore, El Shaddai sends them strong delusion, that they should believe lies made by the fallen ones, that they all might be damned which believed not the truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness. Yet in Yahweh’s judgment and abiding mercy, pleasures will now be taken from the earth and the delicacies that natural man lusts so strongly to hoard will be taken from the earth. And so even the pleasures of sin will be taken from the earth, so much so that men will achieve madness as they seek to satisfy the lusts of their hearts. However, Yahweh does not choose these actions to be cruel to his creation but to punish evildoers

and to wake those who, otherwise, would refuse to wake from slumber because through the pleasures of sin and wages of unrighteousness have they been made fat and blind. Instead of full and sudden judgment natural man is given grace because natural man is overcome of the fallen ones.
Yes, in Yahweh’s grace and mercy and in his eternal plan Yahweh does seek to wake natural man from sin and to call natural man to righteousness. Of which call many have responded voluntarily to my salvation in my times of grace by way of the gospel of Salvation. In which times, salvation was a free gift where a person could make me Lord and have time to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling as they fully come to me even fully out of sin. And so it is that my times of grace have reached their end, though grace and mercy are ever with me. And it will shortly come to pass that times of waiting will be no more and that the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of your Lord, and of your Christ, and I will reign for ever and ever with the faithful in our eternal inheritance that I will share fully with my overcomers.
And a great multitude will come to me during Jacob’s trouble to save them eternally. And all who call on the name of the Lord till the end shall be saved, no matter the language or nation from which they call. And I do move to save Israel, and I am calling my true kinsman who have been led astray by false religions and have been oppressed by the Synagogue of Satan, and they will achieve eternal salvation and I will yet save Jacob of whose salvation will yet be accomplished by the refiners fire. But understand that the times of long lives and material prosperity on the earth have come to an end until my Kingdom is shortly established, and the earth is held in chains awaiting its final judgments to be poured out in great wrath. Behold! The wrath of the Lamb comes first, and great troubles will wash over the earth like a deluge of utter destruction, and many shall perish.
Yet, great troubles and distresses will be unleashed when the seals are broken and great wrath, and many plagues and pestilence, and famine, and drought, and war, and injustice, and death and much more will come fully on the earth; yet a multitude of multitudes will awaken from their luke warm ways. And they will be in great bitterness and anguish of soul when they realize the infallible truth of scripture and how they stubbornly missed their opportunity at salvation and to escape wrath and judgment at the gathering of my faithful Church to myself. Yet in their bitter distresses and anguish I will inspire an unconquerable resolve within them and I will draw them fully to me even, all those who come to me in torment and distress and through the trials of martyrdom. And great reward will they have, reward so great that their coming troubles are not worthy to be compared to the eternal glory that is to be revealed fully in them.
So it is written and so will it be completed to the uttermost: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sits on the Throne shall dwell amongst them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
And so the spider has woven its web around the world in great deception, blackmail, extortion and in many ways does the spider’s venom work it’s evil through its deceptive and poisonous ways. For a web of deception has it woven and a web of debt has it woven so that the world is now fully woven into the spider’s embrace and is paralyzed by its venom. The spider has moved with great stealth and deception via the mystery of iniquity, and the earth is now fully in its web. And in great deception have these pretenders

(made by the fallen ones) invaded the lands like locusts. Even in the same way that the spider cocoons it’s eggs until a multitude of it’s young break free and scurry off to weave their webs alongside it. And so the Synagogue of Satan has taken the world both by force and by craft.
And over time and through many wiles and schemes they have made themselves mighty, for so is given them by Yahweh in his eternal plans of salvation to accomplish. Because natural man is blinded by their lies and follows them ignorantly to his own demise. Of which plans I speak will culminate in final separation between the wheat and the tares and between the fully committed and those who love their sins and willingly chose the flames in their sordid love affair with their own destruction, and they will eternally regret their choice they have chosen to align themselves to suit the spider’s purposes. And so the vials of the indignation of the wrath of God will then be poured out in full.
Understand that the spider is the synagogue of Satan who is now ready to overtake the earth in their final beast system of which rule I will make an eternal end and of whose destruction and judgment lingers not. Understand, my loves, that the Synagogue of Satan are all pretenders who pretend. They are Edomite tares whose ancestors I faced as the lamb of God as I willingly gave myself to pay for the sins of mankind. And so I exposed them, and so I told them straight to their evil faces: You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do: he has been a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, then he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
And so since their initial invasion of the promised land that is not theirs to claim, have they persecuted, tortured, and committed outright genocide on the rightful inhabitants of the lands of promise. They pretend to be the rightful heirs of salvation, even misapplying portions of the law of Moses in their Talmudic false religion. And by such means they have blinded many who think they adhere to my will thinking that I will bless whoever blesses these tares and I will curse whoever curses these tares. And so many of my people ignorantly join themselves to the synagogue of Satan by consent and I surely do command you to repent fully of their lies you have chosen for your own delusion.
My little ones understand that I, Christ Jesus, never authored any study Bibles but these are used as tools of deception with lies given in the margins to interpret truth. And the fallen ones have altered my words in false Bibles, therefore, look to the Byzantine line of texts, even the Textus Receptus where I preserved my Words. Therefore, come to me my loves and learn of me and I will take you fully into the truth of their present deceptions if you will yet humble your heart to my voice given by those who speak for me.
Understand that it is I, Jesus the Nazarene who confronted these same type of pretenders for their oral traditions that they elevated above the pure Words of Yahweh given to Moses. For the law of Moses is holy, and just, and upright forevermore and should any man curse the law of Moses then that man shall himself be accursed. For I, Jesus the Nazarene, did fulfill the law of Moses as I gave my sinless blood at Calvary for the sins of Adam (and all of his descendants) and the law of Moses is kept fully by my loved ones who walk by faith in me, Christ Jesus, their ascended and everlasting Lord.
So understand it is impossible to violate theLaw of Moses when a person walks by faith as I lead them by my spirit that I have created within them forevermore. Though, any who walk in the flesh are in violation because Moses came to condemn sin in the flesh by giving that eternal law of delight written by the finger of Yahweh himself. And no flesh is righteous in my sight and neither in the sight of the everlasting God of

righteousness. Therefore, confess your sins and shortcomings to me, the Lamb of God who is your eternal high priest forever after the Order of Melchizedek and I will fully cleanse you in my atoning blood that is shed for the cleansing of all who come to me for salvation.
Who hath heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Will the earth be brought forth in one day? Or shall a nation be borne at once? Yet so it is that the nation of Israel came back into existence as a nation by the declaration of tares, and it was God himself who allowed his enemies to pretend ignorantly in their deception that they are of Jacob and not Esau because it was Esau who sold his birth right to the younger. And so the spider ignorantly and arrogantly thinks that it will bring in an eternal golden age on the earth for so is the lusts of their Fathers that they will do and the fallen ones are their Fathers even the Satans of whose nature they partake.
And yet they have invaded the lands with great violence for so is given them to accomplish to awake those who slumber, even all those who are in partial blindness who will respond to the call of their the promised land, even Yeshua the True Messiah. And understand that I do see every evil deed they undertake, and I do see every injustice they inflict on the innocent and I will repay says the eternal Lord of whom Yahweh has made Messiah, King, High Priest, and Lord! Every evil deed is recorded perfectly in the heavens, and they will be recompensed eternally and to the uttermost in their eternal inheritance in the hottest flames of cobalt blue in the blackness of darkness forever.
And I do see Rachel weeping for her children as they suffer genocide and unjust affliction by the synagogue of Satan and I will repay, says The Lord of Lords and King of Kings and I will yet save a remnant of Israel alive through Daniel’s seventieth week, even Jacob’s trouble. In Yahweh’s eternal plan, he understands that many will never depart into righteousness from the pleasures and deceptions of sin. So instead of bringing swift judgment, Yahweh has instead chosen to bring judgment upon judgment so that events accumulate and progressively get worse. And judgment will accumulate in such manner all those who will eventually choose to call on me in their distress and calamity are even those whom I will save to the uttermost, and they will be led to safety.
And so it is that their purposes will now be revealed. For I will lead my 144,000 to descend onto Mount Zion, and they will follow me step by step as they lead my remnant of Jacob to safety in the wilderness where a place is prepared of God for their safety, and they will be fed and cared for and the dragon, the beast, and false prophet will touch them not, nor find them. But the false prophet will bring the abomination of desolation and many tares will be cleansed from the land, and I will hide my remnant away from the battle of that great day, even the day of my second coming of which day Yahweh has marked in eternities past and is set eternally in his timetable of salvation and that day surely approaches for it is written.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he does judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called, The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it, he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture, and on his thigh a

name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.
So it will come to pass that I will come to take my inheritance by force from the hands of the usurpers and squatters of whose time is at an eternal end, because Satans kingdom will never rise again in like fashion. And I will purge and cleanse the earth of all unrighteousness, and Satan will be bound for a thousand years in torment and great fear of his approaching eternal inheritance in that putrid burning brimstone that burns the hottest flames of punishment.
Even of which flames are created to recompense every evil act they have ever committed since the moment they were created and chose unrighteousness. And every single sin of the fallen ones will be fully given in recompense back to each and every one of them, even every sin they have sinfully committed in great malice against Yahweh himself and his creation of which they have corrupted. And so it is as they are bound and cast alive into the hottest and purest flames of punishment where the fires will burn the hottest blue with shades of white-hot purity. And in those flames of punishment they will be utterly recompensed of all their worthless and detestable actions that will be given fully into their own bosoms a multitude of times over for all eternity.
Because in their judgment they have no mercy! Because in their judgment they have no peace!
Because in their judgment they will never have rest! Because they have taken rest from the innocent!
Because peace they have not known! Because they have shown no mercy!

And they will be fully recompensed in Yahweh’s perfect and eternal judgment that lingers not.
And so will my millennial reign come over the earth fully at the end of Jacob’s trouble, and a reign of righteousness will it be. During this time will all the righteous be made alive, and each will have been resurrected in their time and in the orders of their harvest. The faithful in Christ Jesus who are alive and those who have fallen asleep in Christ will be snatched into the heavens in the twinkling of an eye, and they will be rewarded greatly and some will suffer loss, but all will be made alive fully and eternally evermore.
Then at the end of Jacob’s trouble will the resurrection of the just occur where I will raise to life all the tribulation saints who were martyred for my names sake and I will raise to eternal life all who died in faith under the many covenants of Yahweh even all those who came to their last breath on the earth from Adam to the birth of my Church on the day of Pentecost.
Yet so shall it come to pass my loves so understand what I will yet accomplish: I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land. And I will make them one people in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two peoples, neither be divided any more henceforth into two kingdoms. Neither shall they be polluted any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places,

wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
And we will enjoy the fat of the land and the wolf will lie down with the lamb as peace comes over the entire earth as the earth is restored in righteousness to it’s intended glory. The earth will be ruled in righteousness and I do bring an entire host of kings and priest who will rule the earth in perfect union with me in righteousness, and they will rule with a rod of iron and in such manner will the nations be ruled in righteousness and peace and the ways of Yahweh will saturate the land. And in me, Yeshua HaMashiach will the lion come to full consummation with the lamb even as my eternal purposes are brought together where the Lamb of God is in full union with the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and so righteousness will rule the land and the earth will give her fullness and no evil thing shall enter my kingdom.
And so it will be that the earth will be repopulated after Daniel’s seventieth week, for had the times not been shortened no flesh would survive. And a remnant of Jacob who will come to me and make me their Messiah and I will eternally receive them to myself as Yahweh has promised and foretold. And so the earth will be repopulated in righteousness and the fullness of Yahweh’s kingdom will be restored where the eternal will dwell amongst the mortal and where the angels will freely move and where the veil and curse of the law are removed forevermore. Many feasts will there be, and many Sabbaths will we celebrate, and the nations will pour into my Kingdom to honor their creator and eternal Lord and the great Eternal God, because the earth will be ruled in righteousness and will stand in honor and love to Yahweh who has created all in the manners of creation he has chosen for each of his creations. And in love and righteousness will the earth be ruled.
And yet the corruption of natural man will remain and some will depart from the ways of Yahweh and the currents of rebellion will begin to show themselves yet once again. And Satan will be loosed from his prison of torment at the end of my day of rest, for one day with Yahweh is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day. And Satan will go to gather them together, of whose number will be as the sand of the sea. And they will compass the breadth of the earth, and fire will come down from Yahweh himself to devour all those who would yet once again choose evil and who would attack the camp of the saints.
But understand that evil will not triumph nor will Satans kingdom come into being ever again and all those who follow his evil ways yet once again will find themselves in that great white throne judgment. Where they will be utterly judged and sentenced forevermore to that eternal lake of torment where Satan himself will be forever bound and cast to the flames in his eternal kingdom of rolling burning putrid brimstone for so are they worthy. They are no kings and they are no gods because they are not able to deliver themselves from my mighty hand and I will bruise Satans head utterly and forevermore and my overcomers will trample on every aspect of the enemies kingdom as it is utterly destroyed.
I am King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
I am he who has sent The Everlasting Gospel, having revealed it to my messenger and servant, and by my messenger and servant have the words of The Everlasting Gospel been sent for the obedience of all who will obey the everlasting covenant that I have ratified in my own blood, even The New Testament which encompasses in full all promises and covenants of old that will be fully fulfilled.
I am he who has been sent by Yahweh himself for the fulfillment of all things and my times have come, and I will save Israel fully and purge them fully from The Synagogue of Satan whose times of judgment, calamity, and distress has come.

I am Yeshua HaMashiach whom the Father has sent, commissioned, authorized, and of whom he has shared his throne and authority!
I am he who sends the Words of my everlasting gospel for obedience of all to whom these Words are sent for in these are words are life and peace to the redeemed, and eternal life are found therein.
And the righteous Judgments of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach have been declared and what has been declared by Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach can no one change because these declarations are backed by the throne of Yahweh himself.
Behold! I am coming in the power and authority of the great I AM and I will rule the kingdom of God until my enemies have been made my footstool at which time I will present the subjected Kingdom to the Father of Lights, that El Shaddai may be all in all and that The Almighty God may make his everlasting abode amongst men and rule supreme in harmony, love and peace forevermore over his creation, and of my rule shall there never be an end for Yahweh has so declared and promised to the Fathers of old, and as it is written so shall it be eternally done in everlasting perfection and splendor.
I am that the great I AM has made me and all shall be Yea and Amen forevermore, even an eternal Amen where Yahweh creates a new heaven and a new earth and of which the former things will not be mentioned nor come to mind. Amen and AMEN!
From Yahweh the Great Eternal God!
Hear, hear oh Israel, hear the voice of Yahweh, the great and everlasting God of righteousness whom your Father’s knew and of whom they rejected when they rejected my beloved son who was sent for their salvation and even the entire salvation of Adam, my prodigal son, who have multiplied as the sand of the sea. Hear my voice and understand that I AM he who is eternal and changes not, and I AM he with whom all of my promises are always Yea and Amen for there is none greater than your Everlasting God of Righteousness with whom you have to do.
So understand that although your Father’s rejected their true Messiah whom I sent to them when Judea was ruled by Pontius Pilate preferring instead that he release to them Barabbas. Yet, I am still calling you to accept my beloved son because I AM sending him to you yet once again for your full salvation and now are the times of Jacob’s trouble that shall absolutely issue in Jacob being freed from the Synagogue of Satan whose judgment lingers not.
And understand that I do see every atrocity committed by these evil tares, and they will pay, and I will perfectly restore all they have taken and all they will yet take from my eternal children many times over. Yet I have given free will that all may choose, and by your rejection of Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ, you have taken to yourselves false gods and many of you have aligned yourselves with the Synagogue of Satan. Therefore, I am coming to you in this time and calling you by these Words because I took your Fathers as a tender plant and nourished them with my schoolmaster intended to bring them to Christ, even the Law of Moses.
And I have entered into many covenants with my chosen people, which covenants they were unable to keep due to the sin and corruption that is in their blood. Yet, I AM faithful to my Words and I AM he who

is sending these words to you, even by the works of my mighty messenger whom I have created and given to my Son, Jesus the Christ that he would raise him up for my eternal purposes. And so is the state of the earth that most have chosen corruption and compromise with the fallen ones a sin that you are guilty of O’ Israel whom I have sanctified and chosen for a peculiar people unto myself if you but bow the knee to Yeshua HaMashiach for no other Messiah will I ever send.
And I AM he who sees, records, and remembers every single act committed by those I have created. Especially all those who have rebelled against me and my ways; of whom I will recompense to the fullest for their evil ways for every evil imagination, and for every evil intent of their detestable hearts, and for every evil and detestable act no matter how small because my justice and judgments are perfect in their consummation and execution. Because those who choose to live unrighteously will on account of their choice inherit eternal destruction, whereas all those who choose to live righteously will live in eternal joy, rest, and peace and will grow as calves of the stall.
Therefore, I AM commanding you Israel, whom I love with an everlasting love, to depart from the web of the spider and I will free you fully into Everlasting life and happiness. Depart from your blasphemous Talmud because I, Yahweh, the great eternal God, did not send that book neither by inspiration nor revelation and I did not authorize not one word in that book, and it is an abomination created to lead astray my beloved people, even created by the abominable Fallen ones.
And so I come to you with the same Words I had Moses give to your Fathers when I freed them from Egypt into the land of promise stolen by the evil Canaan. And so Moses cried aloud to your Fathers: I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore, choose life, that both you and your seed may live, by loving the Lord your God, by obeying his voice, and by cleaving unto him: for he is your life, and the length of thy days: that you may dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.
Also, I had Moses proclaim to your Fathers the following everlasting truths that were given to him by me concerning your Fathers, of which proclamation I send by my messenger yet again for the obedience of Israel, and these Words are sent by me the Everlasting God of Israel of which there is no other. And Moses did proclaim that I will raise them up a Prophet from amongst their brethren like unto you, and will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And whosoever will not hearken unto my words, which he shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him. Understand O’ Israel that Yeshua HaMashiach, whom you reject is he whom I have sent for your salvation and to reject him is to reject the everlasting God of Righteousness, even Yahweh himself.
Therefore, understand the gravity of the times you live O’ Israel. On one hand your enemies have overtaken your lands, even the descendants of Esau who sold his birthright to Jacob, and they do seek your full and utter destruction, although many of you have ignorantly joined them in your rebellion of which you have learned from your Fathers. Yet, they will promise you many things and many promises will their false prophet and false Moshiach make because he will speak as a dragon and his promises only bring destruction, so take not their mark or you will join them in their eternal inheritance in the that everburning lake of fire where their worm dies not.
On the other hand you have eternal life and peace given by my own hand, even the loving and everlasting hand of Yahweh himself in the face of my eternal and beloved son Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the

Nazarene my stumbling block of which all who are faithless shall stumble. And in his mighty hands have I placed your future and no man can approach me through Moses any longer, but only through Christ for I have made Jesus the Nazarene the way the truth and the life without whom no man may approach Yahweh the great Eternal God for so have I declared!
Therefore, Israel harden not your hearts at the sound and sight of my words and let them penetrate deeply into your hearts and depth of being and make not the same mistake your Fathers made of which they will be held to account. Reject not my offer of eternal life that I now extend to you personally yet once again. Come fully to Yeshua HaMashiach in full obedience and wait on your everlasting Lord. For he it is that will come to your rescue and lead you to safety with his mighty host of 144,000 Israelites who are born again amongst the tribes and will have the seal of theLliving God in their foreheads.
Therefore, my loves, I implore you to turn to your true Messiah for there is no more need of sacrifice because Jesus the Nazarene is also the Lamb of God who is coming as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and many great and righteous judgments have I given into his hands to accomplish.
And so understand, that I, Yahweh, the great Eternal God am he who is calling Israel to repentance that they may embrace their true Messiah and that I may yet save you by his mighty hand. Hear my Words Israel and choose life that both you and your seed after you may prosper. And so I counsel you yet once again in my love for you my children: Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
I AM t he great eternal and everlasting God of Righteousness, even Yahweh the creator of the heavens and earth and there is none like me.
I AM h e who has sent these words to my beloved people by my mighty messenger of whom I have revealed and sent The Everlasting Gospel to the intent that these Words will find the eyes, ears, and hearts to all those to whom they are sent. And I have chosen my messenger before the foundations of the earth were laid, and I have called, and sanctified, and commissioned him for the revealing of the everlasting gospel that has been revealed in its time.
I AM t he everlasting God of Righteousness who will save my beloved creation and my beloved people from the fallen ones and into eternity and everlasting peace and joy will they go and a new heaven and new earth will I make for them. And I will make my dwelling amongst them and they shall see my face, and they will walk with me in my fields of safe pasture, and I will hold their hand as they walk with me into all eternity.
I AM h e who will be all in all. And I will give them to eat of the tree of life and to walk the streets of New Jerusalem and in complete joy and perfection will they forevermore be. And I will wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things will pass.

O’ Israel, I AM Calling You!
NOVEMBER 3, 2024
From Yahweh, The Great Eternal God:
Hear the Words of Yahweh, The Great I AM and consider my question. Why do rats run from a collapsing house, my children? An obvious answer is for their own survival, except the rats who are running from Secret Babylon do so to hide their crimes, and so they can make spoil of her fully so they may have the short rule that I do give them. Since natural man loves darkness, I will now give him the darkness he so loves. Yet, I have recorded (and will yet record) every deed of every entity in my creation that has freedom to choose because to whom much is given is much required.
And nothing is hidden from my gaze, and nothing is hidden from my sight, and I AM he who does see, record, and remember EVERY evil act ever carried out in my creation. And there is nothing that can happen of which I am not aware and allow! In my sight, all thoughts are laid bare. In my sight every intent of the heart is laid bare and there is nothing or no one that has been created or made that is not under my mighty hand, for I am The Everlasting God of Righteousness with whom you have to do, O’ Israel and I do see you fully, though you choose to disobey me in partial blindness because of the hardness of your hearts.
Because, when I came to you in the person of the only Messiah I have ever sent and the only Messiah I will ever send, I was rejected fully by your Fathers. Because, I AM he who created Yeshua HaMashiach in the flesh for the salvation of all who call on his mighty name, whom you ignorantly reject even arrogantly and blasphemously calling him an idol of the goyim. O’ Israel, so many of you have joined yourselves to the Synagogue of Satan and you now wait expectantly for your false Moshiach that Esau has prepared for Jacob’s slaughter.
So hear the voice of THE GREAT I AM for my thunderous, eternal voice is calling to you in this last time and I do send my Son to you yet once again to redeem Jacob, even a mighty remnant my Everlasting Son, Yeshua HaMashiach, will be saved by his mighty hand and there is no other choice for salvation. Nor will there ever be any other choice or name given for salvation because I have given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus the Nazarene should every knee bow.
And of those who refuse, they will be made to bow to The Lion of the Tribe of Judah who I am sending to the earth that he may judge and make war even in everlasting righteousness, and he it is who shall bring my entire creation under righteous subjection and he will rule with a rod of iron and judgment, grace, and mercy are forever with him. Understand that wide is the way of destruction and many names and false gods do seek to take you to their inheritance of that ever-burning lake of fire, which burns with brimstone the hottest flames of punishment.
O’ Israel, how you have broken Yahweh’s heart in your disobedience and my heart still breaks for you from eternities past where I knew in my foreknowledge that in my plan of redemption your Father’s would reject Jesus the Nazarene in favor of Barabbas, who was a murderer and leader of seditious rebellions in the lands at the time. And so I had him turn to the gentiles, and they did hear him for a season, yet blindness in part happened to Israel that a remnant of Israel might yet come to salvation at the proper time.

Understand that many from Judea did make him their Lord and achieved eternal salvation in The Israel of God and they will be with my son forevermore. And I AM he who has sent Jesus the Nazarene amongst the nations to redeem your brethren who were scattered abroad on account of their rebellion, and even those who had no hope and many from the nations have achieved everlasting salvation and are now forevermore grafted into the tribes. So understand O’ Israel that whatThe Everlasting I AM has cleansed do not call common or unclean!
But you O’ Israel, you did reject and murder my son Jesus Christ and delivered him into the hands of sinful men who were determined to let him go in his innocence. But how else could my plan of eternal salvation come to pass except requirements of the eternal and unchangeable laws of Yahweh are met, of which laws I set for the righteous order of my entire creation to be ruled in perfect justice.
And so Jesus the Nazarene did offer himself as the Lamb of God as your eternal High Priest forevermore after the Order of Melchizedek to pay the penalty prescribed by Moses for the sins and transgressions of mankind and to redeem mankind fully from the curse of the law. Because Moses came as Israel’s schoolmaster to take and preserve Israel for Yeshua HaMashiach and he has paid fully for your redemption, and although you are rebellious students a remnant will respond to my chastisement even the trouble coming to you during Daniel’s seventieth week that is at your doorstep and will soon kick open your doors to an eternal choice.
So understand who you have rejected, O’ Israel, whom I love with an eternal love, for you are those whom I promised your Fathers in many covenants in ages past that in these times of judgment I would preserve you for their sakes, and I am the same Everlasting God of Righteousness who changes not! And I AM HE who does remember the many intercessions made by your Fathers on your behalf and every intercession I do remember word for word and I will honor their request for those of you who are willing to become obedient. And even now my Son, whom you ignorantly hate, makes intercession for you in his eternal love for his kinsman because Yeshua HaMashiach is Israel’s kinsman redeemer, even he who has purchased the earth in his own atoning blood and he has ransomed you from the hands of the enemy should you chose to accept. Although, many among you have inherited your love of Egypt from your Fathers, do not allow yourselves to fall forevermore in the wilderness of the faithless.
Because Yeshua HaMashiach is he who will yet save a remnant from Jacob who will come to him fully, even during the trials of Daniels’s seventieth week. So understand the times you live and awaken from your partial blindness at my command when you turn to Yeshua HaMashiach, whom I have sent for your salvation as your Messiah (when you no longer will be blinded by the hardness of your hearts). Because you will turn to the son of righteousness and he will receive you to himself, and he will take you to safety and hide you from your destruction from the hands of Esau’s false Moshiach..
So understand he with whom you have to do because I AM a God of many covenants, and I AM a God of many promises, and I AM the Everlasting God of Righteousness who comes once again to call my people to return to their Chief Shepherd that I have sent for the salvation of Adam. And there are many aspects of who I am, and each name carries its own significance regarding the Everlasting God. So hear me and hear me well and understand Yahweh, who is calling you to himself that you may yet obtain salvation. And so I remind you and teach you as babes, when it is you in fact that should be teachers, O’Israel! So learn of your Everlasting God of Righteousness!

I AM t he God of Jacob even whom you have left to go into the arms of another, and you have run to your false gods even proud of your rebellion. Understand Israel that you are in the grips of the Synagogue of Satan even those who say they are of Israel who lie and are not.
Hear my voice O’ Israel, and come to Yeshua HaMashiach in this last time because I am calling you in my love for you and I do extend my grace and mercy to you in this time. But you are a stubborn nation and the stubbornness and hardheartedness of your Fathers you have made your own, and you have rejected the God of your Fathers whom you worship in an unlearned and false manner because my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, so come to Yeshua HaMashiach and learn of him so that you may yet achieve salvation at his mighty hand.
O’ Israel, how my heart breaks for you because I took you like a tender plant in a barren wilderness ready to perish and wither away evermore and gave you life and made you a peculiar people unto myself. I entered into many covenants with your Fathers, even covenants they were unable to keep because of the sin and corruption inherent in the blood of Adam. But I AM the Lord Your God who remembers and who has kept my promises and covenants and I will yet fulfill every promise and covenant ever made to mankind even in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach, who is my beloved son Jesus the Christ.
O’ Israel, will you remain faithless and disobedient? Will you forever join your enemies in their eternal punishment? And so it is that you have been disobedient and you have walked in partial blindness, and I have taken your nation from you and you are no longer led by Yahweh The Great Eternal God. But in your

rebellion you are led by the hand of your enemies who pretend and masquerade that they are Jacob when in truth they are Esau. Understand that all who reject Yeshua HaMashiach have turned from Yahweh to false gods and unbelief and many are enchanted and held in bondage to their black cubes that they worship ignorantly in unbelief. So understand, all those who are led astray by their false Moshiach or their false Mahdi in their false faithless religions that do not lead to Yahweh nor eternal life, will find everlasting destruction for all those who chose to remain therein.
O’ Israel, come to me through my son Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Jesus the Nazarene, whom you do reject as did your Father’s before you. Only perish not in the sins of your Father’s and accept my love and the sacrifice that I gave on your behalf, even by which sacrifice all of Adam has been blessed and many from the lands and from the nations have come to their Lord in repentance and they are blessed and redeemed forevermore. And understand that I AM he who has placed all things into Christ Jesus mighty risen, and transformed hands because I AM he who has made him a life giving spirit and of his rule and kingdom there will be no end!
Therefore, all of my covenants from Adam to Moses, and even the testament of Moses is now set to be fulfilled in the face of Jesus Christ even my new covenant which is my new Testament that is given for the fulfillment of all things even from Adam to Christ. Because those who achieve eternal life must submit themselves and bow the knee to my only begotten son, in whom I am always well pleased.
So come to me in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach in whose sinless blood did he ratify his new covenant which is The new testament, that I have fully accepted and planned before the foundations of the world were laid. And I will send my 144,000 led by Yeshua HaMashiach for your salvation and they will hide you away in a place that I have prepared for you and there you will be cared for and saved alive from Esau who is preparing for your destruction.
Yet those who oppress my people, even Esau, are deserting Mystery Babylon because it is their sins they intend to cover, a sin rats deserting a collapsing house are not guilty. Therefore, they will attempt to bury their crimes and even their sinful shovels they used to cover their crimes and I will yet expose them, says The Lord of Hosts. For they have fully plundered Secret Babylon even as I have allowed to happen in my double portion of judgment on that great harlot!
And so they have gathered to themselves all of Secret Babylon’s military might and they will continue to spoil until Secret Babylon is destroyed shortly in one hour and never again will she rise. Understand that no weapon that is formed or fashioned against you will prosper if you yet call on your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach!
So understand that the Synagogue of Satan has a form of godliness in their outer appearances, but they are of their Father the devil and the lusts of their Father will they do because Esau corrupted his offspring forevermore. These evil tares, even your seemingly righteous leaders are evil tares and many are child molesters who prey on the young and who have gone astray in the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they prey on children, and they are not virtuous shepherds but mangy. And the dragon who is their Father is he who leads them, even the same who has provided two mangy shepherds to rule and shepherd the earth in unrighteousness. Even the beast from the sea who will rise as their Mahdi and the beast from the earth, who is also their false Moshiach and will come to rule the land and indeed they will dominate the world in unrighteousness.

And the stain of their mange does stain through their entire being, and salvation can they never attain. Because all who modify themselves genetically in such manner or who are born of the fallen ones have no salvation because they are made in the image of the dragon and of that image they are through and through. That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and every abomination of the fallen ones can only do evil because they were made to bring about the destruction of mankind, and they would have been successful had I not stopped them in the days of Noah.
And yet they will rise again, because I bring giants to fulfill my wrath. And so the synagogue of Satan is working to cover all traces of who they truly are before calamity hits and their deception culminates in disaster because the fallen ones are allowed to destroy Secret Babylon. Yet every sin will be given fully into their bosoms and therefore, it is impossible to hide from Yahweh and my son Yeshua HaMashiach and our wrath will find them even as they try to hide themselves in the heart of the earth.
There are none who are subject to the great judgment who can escape the lake of fire, save those written in the lambs book of life and there are none who can escape their sins save those whom salvation is intended even for those who accept my peace treaty. No matter how many nations they destroy and no matter how far they hide themselves in the earth, they will not escape the vengeance and wrath they have accumulated to themselves and I will repay them to the fullest says the Everlasting God.
Because I will change the earth from its current arrangement to its original glory, and the redeemed of the earth shall walk there in safety. And so what is, will be altered into what will be, and they shall not escape, even all those who are left to judgment where many calamities and disasters will occur, and the ice will melt, and the nations shall change, and the earth will be restored to its former glory. Of which glory the fallen ones changed into corruption to suit their own lusts.
And I am Yahweh the great Eternal God, even he who created the heavens and earth even he who is from everlasting to everlasting and of my own will and counsel did I speak into being the things that are even from that which was not. And So hear my voice, O’ Israel, and even all those of you who seek to ignore my Words in hard-hearted stubbornness. Judgment is about to fully come upon the earth and I will expose all of Esau for who they truly are, and will even expose fully their Father’s of whose lusts they are eternally bound.
Behold! Those of Esau claim their own righteousness, ignorantly thinking they are my chosen people, and their false Moshiach, even that little horn, will claim that he, himself, is God! (There is none like Yahweh, the great eternal and Almighty God!) And the fallen ones cannot deliver themselves out of my all powerful hands, and Yeshua HaMashiach will utterly bruise Satans head as I promised Adam.
There are no depths in the earth where they can hide themselves, though they try, and they are now bound to the earth under the firmament of which they cannot escape. There are no other identities they can assume where I will not see them for who they truly are. There are no forms they can take where I do not recognize and see them fully, all the way through to their polluted hearts. And every last one of the fallen ones from the least to the greatest and all those who follow their evil ways will have their eternal inheritance in those flames of punishment in that ever burning lake of fire where their worm dies not.
So take up a lamentation, O’ Israel for those of you who stubbornly refuse my invitation to eternal life, even all who will decide to follow the fallen ones and all who will join themselves to the dragon and all those

who are of Adam who had the choice of salvation but instead chose their sins that will lead them to the second death should they not call on the name of Yeshua HaMashiach for salvation.
So I will explain the choices you now have left. You either accept your true Messiah, Yeshua HaMashiach that I have sent, and you will be saved into eternal reward and glory, of which your trials and persecution are not worthy to compare. Or if anyone continues with or joins the dragon in their new order, you will have refused eternal life and instead accepted fully your own damnation for the sins of the flesh, and you will rightfully bear your judgment when you were begged to escape by obedience, of which you will have refused.
Any and all who take the mark of the beast, will have forevermore altered the image of Yahweh of which they were created, leaving them in an irredeemable state. Therefore, I beg you to choose life that you may live in all eternity in the love and blessings of your creator expressed fully in the face of Jesus Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach! Otherwise, you will join the fallen ones in their inheritance of burning brimstone in that eternal lake of fire, where punishment and recompense for sins are the only eternity you will ever know.
Understand, that my intent is not to be cruel nor unjust to my creation, but my laws of justice are unchanging and unalterable. And so the creation groans and cries to me mightily under the weight of the fallen ones sins and the sins of mankind, and the times to purge and cleanse the earth in judgment from evil has come; although the seeds of rebellion will remain but never again will the enemies kingdom rise. Although Satan will try his last attack in his little season before he is cast evermore to the fires because he is no king, yet his throne will be unquenchable flames of the hottest purity, and they will have no mercy.
For what do my eternal laws dictate for the disobedient, so call to remembrance that the wages of sin is death, and so Adam sinned and ended his own life in the wages of sin, which is death. Yet the burnt offerings and the sacrifices of old were not enough to fully redeem my prodigal son, and so a perfect sinless man is the only acceptable sacrifice because Adam was perfect and sinless when he sinned.
So I, even Yahweh the Great I AM, has sent Yeshua HaMashiach as promised as the lamb of God who shed his sinless blood voluntarily to pay the penalty of Moses by shedding his own sinless blood in utter agony that mankind might be redeemed from the curse of the law, even all those who choose to become a new creation in Christ Jesus eternally more because this same Christ Jesus is Yeshua HaMashiach!
I AM Y ahweh the great eternal God, and I AM that I AM.
I AM h e who has sent Jesus the Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach, for the salvation of my creation so hear him and obey his Words as Moses commanded.
I AM h e who has sent these Words by my messenger and servant that my son Christ Jesus has commissioned and raised for such a purpose at my command because Yeshua HaMashiach always does the will of his Father and we are one in unity and purpose.
I AM t he Living God who is calling you, O’ Israel, even so that all who are ordained to eternal life may come to the safety of their Chief Shepherd.

So hear my words O’ Israel and come to my son in full repentance and accept his sacrifice, for of a truth should you reject his call there remains no more sacrifice for sin but eternal judgment because you will have willingly and eternally chosen evil over righteousness, and I will give all who make such a choice the full consequences of their decision, yet understand all are free to choose.
I AM h e who will make all things new!
I AM T he Father of Lights who will make his abode with men in the new heavens and new earth that I will fully create in righteousness and nothing that is evil will ever enter therein. And I will give that holy city New Jerusalem to my overcomers and all those who come to Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also Jesus the Christ and they will eat of the tree of life and they will have entrance into that holy and perfect city and I will be there God, and they shall be my people forevermore, Yea and Amen.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you perish from the way.

When They Shall Say Peace and Safety!
NOVEMBER 06, 2024
From Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Christ Jesus:
Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach, whom Yahweh has sent as your Messiah, King, Lord, and High Priest forever after The Order of Melchizedek and bow your hearts in obedience to my Words because I do come to warn the faithful in my Church, and even my Bride, (and all who have ears to hear whether they be near or far) yet once again of the current strong delusion that now is in full effect across the world, only to worsen when the restrainer is shortly, and suddenly removed! Have I not said what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird? Oh, you of little faith!
So I give you to understand once again what I taught my kinsman when I came to Israel as the Lamb of God, so hear my Words! For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, who shall show great signs and wonders, so that if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth: Behold, he is in the secret places, believe it not. For as the lightning comes out of the East, and is seen into the West, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be! So I give you to understand my appearing is at hand and comes suddenly and forcefully, and I will not be denied my possession that I have paid for in my own blood, even my faithful Bride and Body, even my faithful church whom I love with an everlasting love! You are mine!
And so it is, my loves, that false Christs have risen and many have there been. But now the times of the dragon have come and Jacob’s trouble has arrived and all remaining who are of Adam on earth must make an eternal choice. Because it has been given to the dragon to rule the earth along with his two mangy shepherds, even the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth, who is also their false prophet. Will you keep yourselves from falling into strong delusion by obeying my voice? Would you try to follow the world in its delusions and lies into utter destruction by being disobedient to my voice, even when I come to warn you of the current strong delusion that has overtaken the world? Have you allowed your hearts and your faith to be shaken by strong delusion offered you for false hope?
And so it is that nothing can alter the declarations of judgment given by Yahweh himself on Secret Babylon, even judgment that is given into my mighty hands to unleash when the faithful are gathered and the restrainer is removed, and it will suddenly occur just as promised! Even which judgments were announced in warning to the inhabitants of Secret Babylon, a warning they fully ignored as they faithlessly scoffed. Even my many, many warnings given in the mouths of my many prophets who have faithfully declared these Words of warning for many, many years now. Of which warnings I ceased and in their place declaration now stand, even declarations of Yahweh, and of Yeshua HaMashiach, even which declarations are impossible for any entity whatsoever to stop or alter. For what has been declared in the power and throne of Yahweh can no one change, for so are the ways of The Everlasting God of Righteousness, who works all things after the council of his own will.
And so I tell you my faithful, even as I told Simon Peter at the hour of my sacrifice: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired you, to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: therefore when you are converted, strengthen your brethren. And so I come to you in the lateness of this last hour (for the

344

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

hour is almost up) to warn you in similar fashion so you may keep yourselves in the way and I do command you who shine as the lights of the World to strengthen your brethren and strengthen each other with these Words in loving faith and obedience so that all of you may keep and preserve yourselves in the way, so obey my voice and walk therein.
Behold! It is written: And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. Will you succumb to this delusion that is not yours, my loves? Truly, truly, I say to my church, will you run to the embrace of these deceivers? Even those who are sent for your destruction by the dragon himself? Therefore, my loves, continue to come out from among them and be separate! Do not partake of their evil deeds and expectations because many are enchanted by their sorceries and witchcraft, and he whom they have now selected does speak as a dragon, even making great promises and grand speeches of himself and many will follow his pernicious ways and many will be deceived and ensnared and taken, so turn to the sound of my voice and hear my words and run to me my loves, turn not to the left, nor to the right and I will keep you safely in the palm of my eternal hands of which no one is able to pluck you from my mighty grasp.
So why do you allow your hearts to trouble you, my faithful and true, even those whom I love with an everlasting love, even all those the dragon seeks to ensnare in delusion and judgment that is not for you. Therefore, do not join their delusions and come out from among them and be ye separate! And for those of you who have rightfully turned from strong delusion, I do command you not to return in the least. Behold! Neither Yahweh, The Great Eternal God, nor Yeshua HaMashiach will send or have sent any political solutions nor any world rulers to remedy the world’s troubles at this time. Even troubles that are coming in judgment on those on the earth from Yahweh himself, of which judgment can no one escape, except the faithful in Christ Jesus. Understand exactly what I had Paul write to the Ephesians in the Letter I had him write on my behalf to my beloved church:
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness, which are in high places. So understand my loves that my words are unchangeable, so why would I, Christ Jesus your ascended Lord, ever send you an earthly governor, or ruler or king who would stop the judgments to come? How could Yahweh, of whose will I perfectly complete and of whom it is impossible that he could lie ever contradict himself in his eternal plans that are given to me in full for completion?
Because all world rulers have given their consent and power to the dragon, for so is given for them to accomplish because even the enemies of Yahweh obey his voice and will fulfill his will that is given them during this very short season that is about to crash over the earth with great wrath! For the times of the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of the Almighty God has come and there is nothing that can stop, nor hinder in the least what is so soon to be unleashed after I gather my faithful into the heavens. And so I shout! Who can stand against the eternal will of Yahweh, the great I AM?!
Yet, understand during my age of grace I instructed my Church to pray for their world rulers, knowing their world rulers were evil by nature and so that by the intercession of the saints evil would be restrained further (and my restrainer does still restrain), and these rulers could choose what would work for the good and

345

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

well being of those who love God, and so was my age of grace, even though persecutions did abound. And although, the fervent effectual prayer of a righteous man avails much, understand that there are no world leaders given for the salvation of the earth until I come with a mighty host of eternal Kings and Priests who will rule the earth in righteousness at my command because I am Lord of Lords and King of Kings and I am High priest forever after the Order of Melchizedek.
Understand fully and without compromise, there are no world leaders who can bring peace to the earth. There are no world leaders who can bring safety to the earth. There are no world leaders who can restore prosperity to the earth. Although, they will promise peace and safety and restored prosperity, understand they are powerless to give the things they promise, although they will give the world’s worthless goods to those who take the mark of the beast, even the wages of unrighteousness of which will be utterly taken from them in judgment! So follow them not because any and all who follow will eventually be required to take the mark of the beast and those who do are forevermore given to unquenchable, eternal flames of punishment and the world and its worthless goods are passing away. And the dragon will rise fully with his beasts, and the beast from the earth has prepared his venom administered by the serpents bite to inject his venom and iron will be mingled with clay, but they will not cleave one to another.
And so it is written and recorded exactly in the testimony of my revealing, even The Revelation of Jesus Christ so that all may understand who have eyes to see and ears to hear, and a soft heart to comprehend, and so John did write: And the angel said unto me, Wherefore did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns. The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
Therefore, my little ones receive learning and I do give you to understand even though the dragon’s kingdom cannot yet rise fully (because the restrainer will restrain until the restrainer restrains no more, even when the faithful in Christ are taken into the heavens) the fallen ones are allowed to prepare for their surprise attack and God does send those who dwell on the earth in disobedience strong delusion. But these things are not intended for you my faithful and chosen, and I, Yeshua HaMashiach do declare and testify to this truth with these words that I have sent by my messenger and servant to be read for the comfort and obedience by all these words are intended. And so I ask those of you who would prefer this delusion over my everlasting truth, why do you marvel? Will you yet choose the lies of the mangy shepherds over the truth and comfort the spirit of prophecy brings?
Wherefore, I give you to understand that these two mangy shepherds who both are and are not and yet will FULLY be, have not yet fully risen, and they will fully rise from the ashes and ruins of the old order and their new order will rise fully! They have now selected for themselves their false Moshiach, even Barabbas, and he will build their temple, and the beast from the sea still puppeteers his senile old stooge and they will succeed, and they will bring Secret Babylon’s full destruction, for by deception they do war and so is their nature.
And they are sent by the spider who has invaded the lands, and it is the spider who has chosen him to lead the lands when they are fully risen. Because it is the Synagogue of Satan that has made their choice and selected their new false Moshiach and Secret Babylon has once again given her consent to the dragon,

346

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

and so they will fully be given into the hands of the dragon who empowers them to execute wrath and judgment that is even sent as a double portion from Yahweh himself, of which judgment lingers not and is imminent and so they have chosen to themselves their own destruction.
And so it is that Secret Babylon now declares her future to be free from Yahweh’s judgment as they seek to escape as they scoff in their faithless ways. Because Secret Babylon is fully woven into the spider’s web, and she cannot escape, and Secret Babylon is in chains awaiting her final judgment. And they will continue to spoil, rob, murder, plunder and take by force her prosperity and her posterity for so is given them to accomplish and a wasteland will remain where they will plunder the earth further for the resources they so lust.
And then sudden destruction will fall suddenly, and in one hour will she be destroyed. Again I say, that war will suddenly break free across the earth, and fire will fall, and many missiles will they send for her destruction. Her greatest city will burn and great waves of destruction will overtake her east and west coasts. The earth will violently shake, and she will be split up the middle and where a once prosperous heartland stood, waters will remain that will cleave her in two, and she will fully fall in her double portion of judgment. Even a judgment they chose for themselves when they ignored my voice I sent by way of my apostles and prophets and servants both great and small: truly she has ignored one and all to her own demise and never again will she rise. And so the earth is given into the hands of the dragon and he will give his infernal rule to his mangy shepherds who he has raised for his own purposes and they are corrupted forevermore.
Therefore, do not fall for their deception the beast from the earth brings because he does speak as a dragon. Do not follow those of Secret Babylon who are awaiting their judgment, for her judgment surely will come in one hour and suddenly she is not! Because those who could have followed Jesus the Nazarene as their Lord have now been wooed into the arms of a deceiver because they love to live their delusions, thinking that as it is today, it was yesterday, and surely this great king will make me great once again! But, you Secret Babylon, you will never be great again and your sins remain and you will not escape your judgment that is upon you.
And it is I Yeshua HaMashiach, even the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who has given no king on the earth at this time because no other rule has Yahweh established, save the kingdom of Heaven of which, I Yeshua HaMashiach am King of Kings and Lord of Lords! So understand that all who have committed themselves to this deceiver and abandoned their Lord and savior Jesus the Christ will be left to the refiners fire because you are in the arms of a false Christ, who is also their false Moshiach. And so the final separation has come for my age of grace and many have been deceived and carried away as spoil by the beast from the earth. And although, many will depart from his deception into eternal life it will take Jacob’s trouble to break them from strong delusion should they ignore my call to immediately repent in these final seconds.
And so I give you to understand that Yahweh has given the final trumpet to sound, even my final trumpet in my age of grace and the trumpet will sound. Because the time is here and upon you my loves, where I will descend from the heavens with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first and those of you in Christ will join them in the air and so will you ever be with me my loves and I will not leave my faithful to the refiners fire because their refining I have completed in

my love for them because they came to me willingly even when I was revealed to them.
So understand my loves that the hour has come for the dragon to fully rise and for war and judgment to fully come and that the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth may rise fully with their dragon. Had I not shortened the days no flesh would be left alive, and so their surprise attack will fully come on the world and they will utterly destroy Secret Babylon. So do not fall for their delusions and lies as they congratulate themselves and say openly in the face of Yahweh’s judgments and the wrath of the Lamb “peace and safety” “peace and safety”!
Because I am Yeshua HaMashiach who will fully remove peace and safety from the earth until the end of Daniels seventieth week when I establish my Kingdom fully on the earth. Therefore, do not fall for their delusion.
And I am he who does send these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent.
Behold! The time has come for your Lord to shine his glory and majesty across the skies for all to see and I will gather all of my faithful in Christ even from the ends of the earth as I appear in the air to gather the faithful in Christ and my appearing will be seen in the skies in like manner as lightning comes out of the East, and is seen into the west, and I will not be denied!
I am Yeshua Hamashiach who will come to judge and make war on the earth and of my kingdom there will be no end.
I am that the great I AM has made me and the times has come.
I am The Lion of the Tribe of Judah and my times have come.
All will forevermore be, Yea and Amen!
From Yahweh the great Eternal God:
Hear, Hear the words of The Everlasting and Eternal God! The times of Jacob's trouble have come on the earth and the times of harvest have arrived. Then suddenly and unexpectedly will my son, Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach appear in the clouds so both the dead and living in Christ rise from the earth in immortality and incorruption to stand freshly created into all eternity even when they will stand in my very own throne room, even a time that I have yearned and longed for in eternities past.
Therefore, take heed to Yeshua HaMashiach because I have given the order and that time surely approaches and the day and exact time is now known in the heavens, although it has not been revealed fully on earth. And so the times of that last trumpet blast have come and the first fruits will be gathered and the bride groom will join himself in everlasting covenant to his faithful bride and they will fulfill my eternal purposes and the new Testament of Yeshua HaMashiach will be established fully forevermore, because all of my promises are Yea and Amen!
The faithful in Christ will stand at their Lord’s judgment seat and receive for their works whether they be good or bad but all of them do have eternal life. And many will carry off great reward of such that hasn’t entered into the heart of men fully the things I have prepared for them. Because Christ Jesus will make

them Kings and Priests before my throne and they will inherit fully their thrones and authority from Yeshua HaMashiach in his inheritance I have given him to share with the faithful, and called, and proven, and true.
And so I declare to the dwellers on the earth to hearken and obey fully the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach because he does come to judge and make war and the final separation draws near. But first the times of Daniel’s seventieth week will be fulfilled and Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach does come to the earth to save a remnant of Jacob because I AM that I AM, even YHVH The Great Eternal God, and who is there that is like me? Of my equal there is none, and truly never will there be.
I AM he who has given my eternal plans that I concealed in my own heart until they were revealed to my Son, Christ Jesus and The Great Mystery of God has been revealed and is soon to be fulfilled. And I have given The Everlasting Gospel to my Son Christ Jesus and have revealed it with him to my chosen messenger who has returned faithfully to his eternal calling and he will fulfill my eternal purposes under the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, to whom he fully belongs.
I AM the Great I AM so tell them The Great I AM has sent these Words and the times are now.
Behold! Look and watch because the hour is upon you, listen and keep your ears unclogged so you may hear the sound of the trumpet, for the last trumpet has been commissioned to sound and the hour of its sounding is upon you, only do not fall asleep back into strong delusion.
Are you ready? So let it be done at that appointed time marked in my heart before the earth was made.
I AM that I AM and Christ Jesus is prepared to make his appearing even at that times I selected in my own counsel in eternities past, even a perfect time given for the full redemption of the first fruits of righteousness! Behold! The times are now!
And so the great eternal God says, Yea and Amen!

A Lamb With Two Horns.
NOVEMBER 07, 2024
From YHVH: The Great I AM!
Behold! Great deception has come from Secret Babylon and has captivated the earth in its deadly embrace! Step right up to understand the great deception, oh you who dwell on the earth, and understand the times you live, because the great deception is here of which the earth is entertained because their world is a stage and their leaders are actors, even pretenders who pretend. And so I will now reveal the truth concerning their circus with which they use to enchant the masses.
Beware! The great deception has come upon you with many lying signs and wonders and this great deception is intended harshly for the destruction of Jacob, even intentions that Esau has kept secret through the ages, but now will be revealed and exposed for all to see. And as my son, Jesus the Nazarene, told their Father’s in Judea these Jubilees past: You are of your Father the devil and the lusts of your Father you will do. And so I come to you O’ Israel so you may not be taken by this great deception, for you are the intended target (even though the earth will reel) for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?
And it is I, Yahweh even The Great I AM, who comes to warn my people by way of these Words that I have revealed and sent by my messenger and servant who is commissioned for these purposes. So I do come to those who are of the tribes whether they be near or far, whether they be in the land or scattered abroad, and I will gather all of my remnant to their Messiah and Chief Shepherd Yeshua HaMashiach.
For he it is who will lead Israel to safety at the hand of my mighty 144,000 because Jesus the Nazarene have I made King of Kings and Lord of Lords! And he it is who will rule the earth in righteousness during his thousand year reign from the throne of David in Israel which he has inherited. For so I promised your Fathers and I AM he who fulfills every promise I make many, many times over in my everlasting righteousness that all may be yea and amen and I AM the everlasting God of Righteousness who faints not!
Yet, so it is that the dragon will rise fully and the beast from the sea has hidden himself away so that he may rise fully amongst those he will lead, and he will rise from the ashes in his appointed time. He has plundered and arranged for the full destruction of Secret Babylon, even working hand in hand with the beast from the earth to arrange and execute their destruction, and so I have given for them to accomplish. And the world is enchanted by the great harlot and can no longer imagine a world without the oppression of the great whore with which she has oppressed the peoples of the earth and corrupts my creation with the filthiness of her fornication even given to the world from that abominable golden cup in her hands.
And so it is, that I do come to warn you, O’Israel, of the great deception that is about to plunge the world into all-out war and chaos, even a deception they have rehearsed using their technologies for they are all pretenders who pretend, and of their deception will their false prophet make his entrance to the land even as Esau’s false Moshiach.
And Esau does mask and hide himself amongst Israel, even pretending they are Israel as they seek to blend themselves amongst Israel, even hiding their true nature from amongst whom they pretend. (They are tares amongst the wheat and The Lord of Harvest will root them out fully.) And so the dragon rises for it is

his hour, and Christ Jesus will suddenly remove the faithful in Christ from the earth, (both the living and the dead) and then judgment will fully come onto Secret Babylon even that great scarlet whore foretold by John the Revelator these many jubilees past.
And I AM the Ancient of Days, even the Lord of Spirits and I do testify, so all may understand my speech: The thing that has been will come to pass again: and the thing that has been done, is done again, and there is no new thing under the sun. And so it is that the fallen ones have worked to destroy Adam from the earth since the beginning that they may take it for themselves, even my garden of life where I tend and nurture the souls of men in order that I may redeem them from corruption in Christ Jesus whom I have created as the last Adam. And it is in your Messiah, O’ Israel, that the Israel of God will be fully gathered and redeemed as one new man fashioned in like manner as your Lord and redeemer, who purchased your redemption in his own atoning blood.
So understand O’ Israel that Jesus the Nazarene is Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Christ Jesus (understand the emphasis of his names because your salvation is complete) so hear his Words in obedience for the sake of your own souls, because you have no time to argue any longer with your creator nor do you have time to reject your true Messiah any longer.
And it is written the same as I declared, and so I had Yeshua HaMashiach reveal to his apostle Paul concerning him: Wherefore, Elohim has also highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, That at the name of Jesus should every knee bow, both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord, unto the glory of God the Father. And so it is, that I YHVH, The Great I AM, do once again certify the authenticity of these Words so that your faith may be unshakable.
The great deception is here and many will be ensnared therein and many will fall to the flames, even all those whose names were never written in The Lambs Book of Life from the beginning. Because, I El Shaddai, AM he who knows the beginning from the end and although, I give every soul the chance to live a righteous life before me, I do know who will choose to fill up their sins to the fullest from those who will come to Christ that they may be recreated in righteousness and my judgments are perfect in my righteousness.
But you O’ Israel, you have no righteousness because you have rejected the everlasting God of Righteousness because you reject my only-begotten Son that I sent for remission of sins as the lamb of God, therefore, your sins remain. And so I counsel you, Israel, hear the Words of The Great I AM in this last time and accept my sacrifice!
Yes, Israel, I provided a perfect sacrifice for you because Adam was corrupted in perfection and the life of the flesh is in the blood. And so sin is passed by the blood which is the life of the flesh from the Father to his offspring that whether they be male or female they inherit corruption because Adam is evermore corrupted. In my eternal mercy and love I provided that which is impossible for any other being to accomplish: I created and gave my only-begotten Son, of whom Moses commands your obedience, for the sins of all mankind, whether they be Judean or gentile, whether they be bond or free.
Yet so it is Israel that your enemies lust for your destruction because they do desire to have their golden age yet once again, even a golden age they will never again regain because instead of their antediluvian,

willfully sin filled golden age where abominations of all sorts roamed, they will instead have harsh judgment and punishment as their kingdom is utterly destroyed. And it will shortly come to pass that the beast and false prophet will be cast alive into that burning lake of fiery brimstone and Satan will be bound for a thousand years in torment and great fear of his coming inheritance in the eternal flames of punishment where their worm dies not.
And the dragon is bound to the earth that they may enter into the heavens no more eternally but are kept under the firmament bound to the earth for judgment of which they lusted, and the dragon has great wrath in his defeat, because he is utterly defeated at the hands of Yeshua HaMashiach who is the promised seed of the mother of all the living, for so I promised Adam and Eve in my love for them. So it is that he is only allowed to fulfill my eternal purposes before he is evermore sent to the flames, and I will set the seal, and they will not come to mind nor be mentioned for so is your future of promise where you are freed from your oppressors forevermore and in eternal and perfect peace will you live if you but bow the knee to your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach, for there is no other way!
So it is that I will now give you to understand things that are about to happen, and surely the snare set by the fowler is to be revealed, even a snare set by the dragon who seeks to ensnare my precious doves, even my peculiar people whom I reserved for myself. And I AM he who caused Noah’s dove to return with an olive leaf in its mouth, and in like manner, I AM he who has sent my eternal peace treaty in the face of Jesus Christ, your risen Messiah O’ Israel!
And so, understand the times you live. The Synagogue of Satan moves with many lying signs and wonders, and by deception they do war. They perform their rituals openly, thinly veiled entertainment and news and political rallies. They have completed their selection process, where Esau has now selected his lamb from amongst The Synagogue of Satan for their blasphemous deception with which they seek to ensnare. But the beast from the earth is not the Lamb of God they foolishly and blasphemously mock, but their false prophet who they have now selected for themselves who has two horns like a lamb, but speaks like the dragon.
And so I had my Son, Jesus Christ the Righteous, reveal in The Choice is Yours (study to learn) when Barabbas received a head wound as if it were to the death and that event had multiple meanings that he did not reveal at the time, but it was at this rally, even his selection ritual where they say, that Yahweh himself bored a hole in his ear making him my divine servant. And so it is, I do swear by my own name, even YHVH The Great I AM, that I have neither made him my bond servant, nor have I given any other Messiah except my only-begotten Son, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who is the only lamb of God I will ever send. And so his assassination attempt was used as one of many lying signs and wonders where this pretender does pretend. And of this pretender he is not of my nature nor my flock and he is my enemy.
Yet, many in Secret Babylon who pretended that Jesus Christ is their Lord have now abandoned their potential Lord in favor of Barabbas, who speaks like a dragon and yet is a lamb with two horns. And yet many of those who have made Barabbas their Lord will be left to the refiners fire because their salvation was not fully completed because they did not come to Christ fully with faith filled and repentant hearts but instead with the lusts the prosperity gospel does produce. Because The Synagogue of Satan corrupted their holy writings by their consent and Zionists they have now become. And yet many of these same souls, will be given the honor of martyrdom for their salvation if they chose to accept salvation by calling on the name

of their Lord Jesus Christ till the end, and I will receive them eternally and evermore and their sufferings will not compare to the glory that is to be revealed in them.
So, this false moshiach does travel and preach while speaking as a dragon and does pretend and say many great and blasphemous things even before he rises fully, and he will claim to rise. Understand my people that this false prophet who is also the beast from the earth who serves The Synagogue of Satan has now been selected as their lamb. And it will yet be that his head will appear as it were wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world will wonder and follow the beast. And so this deceiver will rise.
At his rising he will claim he has sacrificed himself like a lamb of God bringing peace to Israel as their dove which brings them an Olive leaf! And not only Israel, but the earth itself and will appear that he has now come back to bring peace, but the ways of peace he does not know and at the judgment of Secret Babylon all out war will ensue. Because a false spirit of comfort from the dragon has settled on the earth, and I have even sent strong delusion so that all those who have pleasure in unrighteousness will believe a lie that all might be damned who have pleasure in unrighteousness. For when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction and they shall not escape.
And many in Secret Babylon, even those who believe his lies and follow his good words and fair speeches are captivated and ensnared by a false peace where they imagine that their delicious and sinful lives will continue where today is as yesterday and tomorrow will be the same as today and many will scream, howl, and lament that their hope is now taken from them, and they will fight their countrymen to the death and all the while their full surprise attack will be fully unleashed, even as my restrainer is lifted from the earth and Secret Babylon will fall to a double portion of judgment in one hour as many calamities fall.
And The Synagogue of Satan will have their war with which they have genocided the innocent in their deception to incite and those who worship their black cubes will exhaust themselves in slaughter, even a slaughter that is brought about purposefully by great deception and from the ashes will they will rise. And the fallen ones will fully reveal themselves offering mankind seemingly benevolent help but their ways and technologies are intended to ensnare all they can in their inheritance in the flames of punishment, of which they will never escape and where they will receive many times over for EVERY single sin they have committed and justice will be done. But what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?
So I give you to understand, that Secret Babylon’s judgment has been prepared and they stand at the ready. But first this false lamb with two horns will pretend to be virtuous when in fact he is a mangy shepherd, one of two horns to rule, even the little horn of Daniel. And he will appear that he has endeavored to save Secret Babylon by purging her corruption but in truth he is a great corrupter who ensnared many that he will now purge and blame for his corruption with which he extorted many into submission. And now all that does not suit their purposes, or who can testify first hand of their evil will be removed by the hands of this mangy shepherd and blamed for the sins they still partake and of which they lead others, and they will not escape.
And, also understand that many who are party to their crimes and who are tares like unto these mangy shepherds will move into their bunkers and hide themselves in the heart of the earth from the wrath to come and they will destroy all evidence of the lives they assumed in Secret Babylon in great deceit, and they will not escape the wrath to come! Yet, so it is that their sins will be exposed hypocritically by this false prophet and he will appear to be just and upright, even a man sent by God for the salvation of Israel

and so the trap is ready to spring. And yet, every one of their deeds I have recorded in the books in the heavens, and I do personally remember every detail and I know all of their crimes and I will expose them and they will eternally pay forevermore for their vile sins.
And so the beast from the sea is preparing himself to rise as their Mahdi and the beast from the earth is preparing himself to rise as a false lamb for what lamb has two horns and speaks as the dragon. Yet Esau has prepared to receive him to themselves in the land he seeks to steal and they will be utterly rooted out by the mighty hand of Yeshua HaMashiach whom I have empowered, even sharing my own throne with my beloved Son and he will utterly crush the head of the snake and all of his enemies will be made his footstool because it is the fallen ones who refused to bow the knee at my command in their rebellion and it is they who attacked my creation by craft and malice and they will pay for all eternity.
And so I swear by my own name yet once again that, I YHVH The Great I AM, do swear that the only Messiah I have ever sent to Israel and truly ever will send is my only begotten son, Yeshua HaMashiach whom your Father’s rejected and whom you reject on account of their lies you inherited from their hardened hearts passed down in your blasphemous Talmud. And so I come to you in my love for you O’ Israel so that I may expose to you fully the trap that is set for you by Esau who still seeks the destruction of Jacob.
The beast from the earth has enchanted you as your false prophet and he will rise and come to you as your sacrificial lamb who sacrificed himself for Israel and will pretend to be your true Moshiach. When in fact he is polluted by Esau and no Moshiach will ever rise from Dan. Indeed, he comes for Jacob’s destruction but the trap he sets will ensnare those who willingly follow him and so they will be taken forevermore by his lies and they will accept his mark that he will seek to force on the world for its enslavement and destruction.
And so I say to you O’ Israel bow the knee in obedience to your true Messiah who came to you as the Lamb of God, whom your Father’s rejected on account of Esau. Bow the knee to your Lord of Lords and King of Kings and accept my salvation that I may yet redeem you from the curse of the law because no man is righteous who comes to me through Moses, except the man Christ Jesus who I have changed forevermore, and after the flesh he is no more known. Because, I have glorified him in similar fashion as Pharaoh glorified Joseph and shared his throne, except in the throne he was greater than Joseph and retained his authority.
Because:
I AM h e who is from everlasting to everlasting and there is none greater than the Great I AM!
I AM h e who has sent these Words to my beloved people that I may come to you and remove your partial blindness when your hearts turn fully to your Messiah! Even your true Messiah, Christ Jesus the resurrected and glorified Lord!
I AM T he Everlasting God of Righteousness who faints not, and I ask, is there anything too hard for my mighty hand to accomplish?
So I implore you O’ Israel to obey the voice of YHVH even your Elohim who was shepherd to your Fathers by the hand of my servant Moses whom I had rescued when he was drawn from the waters of the Nile to the safety and kingly preparation in Pharaohs house of which he defeated in obedience YHVH!

I AM Y HVH the great I AM and I swear by my own name that it is I who raised Jesus the Nazarene from the dead after he sacrificed of himself as the lamb of God, even a sacrifice that I accepted for all time and forever more for the redemption of Adam as a new man in Christ Jesus who is Yeshua HaMashiach your true Messiah!
And I AM he who does certify the authenticity of these Words that I have sent in The Everlasting Gospel that has been revealed by myself, and Yeshua HaMashiach to our mighty messenger who has been prepared by Yeshua HaMashiach in much chastisement and purification for my eternal purposes and faithfully has he returned to Yeshua HaMashiach and so he is restored!
And so I invite you my people, even Israel whom I do love with an eternal love, to join the Israel of God and come to Yahweh, even the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob by way of Yeshua HaMashiach that you may be gathered eternally in the Israel of God and return to me by way of your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach. And I will receive you to myself and restore you to your inheritance and reward that is in Christ Jesus mighty hand.
There is no other name given whereby men may approach YHVH, The Great I AM for so have I declared, so kiss the son lest he be angry and you perish from the way.
Behold! The times are now and the harvest of first-fruits has come and they will be gathered to their Lord and they will be glorified for my eternal purposes.
I AM that I AM and I AM YHVH so obey my eternal voice and come to The Father of Lights who has already prepared your way.

The Gathering of the Faithful in Christ!
NOVEMBER 10, 2024
Behold, Behold! Understand what is about to be unleashed on the earth.
Behold, Behold! Surely the wrath of the lamb is upon you mystery Babylon. And as I, Yeshua HaMashiach have warned, so to will it be done!
Behold, Behold! The day is upon you oh Secret Babylon and your day of judgment has come, even a day that will unleash that great day promised of old even the day of the Lord! Woe to you inhabitants of the earth because great wrath is about to be unleashed fully upon you, and you will not escape and truly, truly Daniel’s seventieth week has come.
And so I counsel my church, my body and even my bride to gird yourselves in my righteousness and prepare yourselves to stand upright before your Lord, even in the throne room of Yahweh, where I will present the firstfruits even all those who I will gather who have fallen asleep in Christ and are at rest waiting for my call, and even all who are alive on the earth who are faithfully in Christ at the time of my appearing. And in like fashion where I presented myself to Yahweh as the firstfruits from the dead, in such manner you are identified with your everlasting Lord of Righteousness. Because in the same manner that I was taken into the heavens, so too will you be taken into the heavens, where I will present my firstfruits of harvest without spot or wrinkle of any such thing.
And you will all stand before my judgment seat, even that great judgment seat where your works will be judged and some will be recompensed, and some will suffer loss and some will experience both loss and reward as the wood hay and stubble are burned away because none of you have walked perfectly before me and yet in Yahweh’s love you will be utterly astounded at the magnitude of your inheritance. And of my overcomers your reward is great and you will inherit all things just as I did when I overcame the fallen ones. However, all who are gathered to their Everlasting Lord, even Yeshua HaMashiach will come to newness of life as they are recreated for all eternity and never will you be corrupted nor change from the perfection that awaits you, because Yahweh has so declared!
And suddenly will you be taken, and the world will know that I have appeared, and the restrainer will be removed! And in the absence of my restrainer all force and influence of evil will be fully unleashed on the earth. And it is I, Yeshua Hamashiach even Christ Jesus, who declares these Words and so these Words will be known on the earth, and they will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those to whom they are sent.
And so it is, and so it will be but for only an extremely short time the Dragon’s kingdom will rise in full, for so has been given for them to accomplish. Because when I was rejected of my kinsman, even Israel of whom I am kinsman redeemer, I turned to the nations so that the nations would be blessed, even as Yahweh promised of old. And my Words were received mightily, even through great persecution and many trials, and the gates of hell did not prevail against my Church. Yet, even so as my Church is removed, and my restrainer is removed evil will fully overtake the earth, and they shall not escape.
Even all who have pleasure in unrighteousness and who are willing to reject Jesus the Nazarene in favor of Barabbas and when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction, and they shall not escape.

And yet the Dragon will reveal himself, and he is bound to the earth and from the heavens he is banished forevermore never to return, and he has great wrath because he knows his time is short, and yet he foolishly thinks he can still defeat me Yeshua HaMashiach, even though I soundly and utterly defeated him at Calvary in my atoning works of salvation that culminated with It is finished!
And the fallen ones somehow think they can escape their long promised judgment because they are afraid of their future more than anything; because they understand in their own cruelty they have shown and do show no mercy. Because they know they have shown no mercy, therefore, no mercy will be shown to them. They are well aware that all of their unrighteous and detestable acts will be forevermore given to them a multitude of times over in that great lake of burning brimstone where the flames of punishment can never be quenched. Even flames created that will recompense every evil work they have committed into their bosoms, and they will utterly pay and in utter agony will they forever be.
Because they attacked Yahweh and they attacked the garden of God, even as they pretended they were gods and their judgment has come. Yet so it is, that the fallen ones have lulled to sleep the masses with their technologies, and frequencies and with the pleasures of sin and the wages of unrighteousness. Yet, so it is that men loved darkness rather than light, so now I will give them the darkness they so desire.
Because all pleasure is to be taken from the earth and lives of sinful and extravagant prosperity will never be seen on the earth again in like manner where men heap to themselves treasures and forsake their fellow man in their greed and unrighteousness, even sneering down at those in need as they step over them on their way to accumulate more wealth. Natural man is so ensconced in the pleasures of sin that he will not even lift a finger to help those in need, and so I will not lift a finger to help him escape his judgment because natural man is now given into the hands of his enemies. And so it will be that these things will not survive Daniel’s seventieth week and will never again occur in such manner in my Kingdom of righteousness!
Yet so will it be that when the restrainer is taken the evil that is latent within mankind due to the serpent’s wiles will now go unrestrained and madness will overtake the earth as brother will kill brother and countrymen will fight their countrymen and extreme chaos and war will overtake the earth. And yet this event is the destruction and judgment of mystery Babylon, but the seals are set to be loosed, and the horseman will ride!
And so the great falling away is happening as foretold. Because at the time of my appearing, when many should have been waiting and purifying themselves in my Word and spirit, and instead of completing their salvation in my loving arms, they instead forsook their Lord, even Christ Jesus, in favor of Barabbas to whom they have given their hearts. And just as Pontius Pilate, who was determined to release me from their baseless pharisaic lies and accusations, offered the people of the land a choice. And so Pilate said to them when they were then gathered together, whether will you that I let loose unto you Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? And they said, Barabbas. Pilate said unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ? They all said to him, let him be crucified.
And this was so because Esau exerted his evil influence over the people so they would take to themselves a murderer instead of he who was sent for their salvation, even Jesus the Nazarene! And yet how else was the penalty of the law of Moses to be fulfilled but by my sacrifice of myself in bitter agony as the lamb of God, even where I offered myself for the sins of the world as the high priest forevermore after the Order of Melchizedek. Even so, in Yahweh’s foreknowledge he knew fully that Israel would reject their true Messiah

and so he used the fallen one’s hate and jealousy against them, for had they known the great mystery of God they never would have crucified your Everlasting Lord of Glory!
Yet so it is, that Melchizedek King of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the Priest of the most high God. And so Abram made his offerings as required to honor Yahweh and so is Melchizedek an Order of faith that was a shadow of things to come. Because as it is written of faithful Abraham who lived by faith in the Most High God and by his example the just shall live by faith forevermore! And so have the gentiles been blessed and included into the tribes amongst the Israel of God, and they do partake of the promises made to the Fathers to the fullest because they have been adopted by Yahweh himself even by my mighty hand, so what God has cleansed do not call common or unclean, O’ Israel!
Yet so it is that my day has come. And I will not share my glory with another, and God has sent strong delusion that they should believe a lie. Because those who follow Barabbas do so because of their lusts because they imagine themselves part of his promised golden age that is actually not intended for them, though he does lie. Because the golden age he promises is based on the fallen ones golden age in the days of Noah where the fallen ones dominated the earth in unrighteousness! Therefore, when Barabbas speaks of a golden age he speaks truly of their hearts intent, except they fully seek the full destruction of Adam so their abominations and tares can overtake the garden of God forevermore. And so it is, you now understand why no flesh would be saved alive had God not shortened the days.
And yet no golden age will they have because I am the promised seed of the woman who will utterly crush the serpents head forevermore and I will utterly crush in full the entirety of his kingdom and they will not stand. So in place of their coveted golden age, they will instead have harsh judgment and their kingdom will be utterly destroyed right in front of them never to rise again, and the seals will be loosed, and the trumpets will blow, and my remnant will be hidden away and then the vials with the full wrath of God will be poured out, and they will be in great torment and agony even as they see their defeat approaching fully.
Therefore, those who foolishly follow Barabbas even as he foolishly pretends that he is sent of Yahweh, knowing good and well he is of the dragon instead and of whom he is chosen to lead the land and even the world with the beast from the sea. Yet so it is, many who have fallen away into the arms of this pretender and forsaken Christ Jesus will now be given into his hands as the faithful are taken. And there are those who would accuse me of forsaking my Church when instead it is those who are not in Christ who have forsaken me by joining Barabbas, and I did warn them that they are to abide in the vine for without me, you can do nothing.
Even though many will perish whose names were never written in The Lamb’s book of Life and they will perish from the earth when their judgment arrives, and suddenly will their hopes be dashed in an instant.
Because they did not have hopes of righteousness!
Because they did not have hopes of justification!
Because they did not have hopes of sanctification!
Because they lost all hope of their Lord returning for them even as I promised in my New Testament and every promise of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach will be fulfilled for all time and forever more!
For my age of grace and mercy has come to a close, although grace and mercy are with me forevermore,

and as it is written so shall it be done that both Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach will have mercy on who we will have mercy for who can stand against the throne of Yahweh for he is the most High God and there are none like him! So understand that wrath is readied and about to be unleashed on the earth even as my birth pangs have announced and foretold, and that day has come!
And so I announce my appearing, and it will happen just as written in scripture and my bride will be forevermore united in covenant with their bridegroom and all who are taken into the heavens at the time of my appearing, whether they be living or dead, will be recreated forevermore in eternal newness of life. And all those who have truly committed themselves to the good words and fair speeches of Barabbas will fall away from my gathering together even as leaves that have withered in sin. And yet, many who fall away will come to me through great trials and tribulation and a great many of them will call on my name to the end and a multitude of multitudes will come out of Daniel’s seventieth week into eternal life, though most will take the mark of the beast and fall to the flames eternally.
Therefore, I, Christ Jesus even your risen and ascended Lord, do command my faithful to come fully out from amongst them and be separate from them fully. Ready yourselves my loves! Do not partake in their protests, avoid their crowds, and at all costs avoid the evil that is gathering itself under a false spirit of peace because their attack is surely at the ready. Understand my loves that you would be walking into their trap if you were to join them in such manner. My loves, it is time to abandon the cares of this world, because your lives are hidden in me, Christ Jesus, and are about to be revealed fully so that you know even as you also are known.
So understand the deception that is upon you my loves and hide yourselves and wait for my appearing, for it is at hand! Understand their deception, that the lamb with two horns will fake his own head wound, and he will appear to rise the dead and healed from his head wound but all he offers as confirmation of his false claims that he is their Moshiach are lying signs and wonders and neither Yahweh the great I AM, nor me, Yeshua HaMashiach have sent this deceiver, although he is allowed to come into his own at his appointed time so he may rule with the beast from the sea and with the dragon as their head for so is given them to accomplish in Yahweh’s eternal plan of redemption for Adam!
And so I tell you my loves to wait patiently for me and believe not their lies because there is no one or nothing that can stop my appearing for the faithful in my Church, although they will seek to cover this event with a fake alien invasion and a world war that will eclipse all wars ever to come before on earth. Yet, their war will pale in comparison to the battle of that great day where they will be utterly decimated when I come to the earth with the hosts of the heavens because in righteousness I do come to judge and make war!
I, Yeshua HaMashich have sent these Words by my servant who is my faithful messenger, and it is I, Yeshua HaMashiach who does verify this testimony given in The Everlasting Gospel that has been revealed in its time.
I am he who will now turn to Israel to redeem them from the earth as their kinsman redeemer and I am calling you O’ Israel because it is time to accept your true Messiah, because in like manner that this deceiver will betray and destroy mystery Babylon, in like manner he will betray the people of the land in his abomination of desolation that surely approaches.

So understand that they will crawl away to their bunkers to hide themselves in the rocks of the earth, and many will perish therein. And so I ask, where is it anyone can hide to escape my eternal gaze, or who can escape Yahweh’s sight because all is seen and known and whatever happens on earth is allowed to happen either in judgment or for the salvation of those who will call on my name to the end or for those who accept me as their Messiah, and all who commit evil will be recompensed fully.
And I am he who will appear suddenly in the skies in great glory and they will know and many will understand that they have missed this one event they were so sure of themselves they were part, but they are denied due to their sinful lives because sin will not ever enter the heavens nor stand in my presence.
Behold! The times have come and so I will now move to gather the faithful.

O’ Israel! Which Lamb will you Choose?
NOVEMBER 13, 2024
Hear the Words of Yahweh the Great I AM and run to the sound of my Words that you may receive wisdom and that the wise man amongst you may become wiser still.
Behold! I come to tell you of things to come that you may know the surety of my Words and that you may come to your full salvation in Yeshua HaMashiach, who truly is your true Messiah, King, Lord, and High Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
Therefore, I do command that you hear him with your full being and that you circumcise your heart’s in obedience! Because, it is Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ in the English tongue who is given not only for the salvation of Israel, but even for the salvation of the entire race of Adam because all who call on the name of the Lord till the end shall be saved whether they be an Israelite or of the nations, and Yeshua HaMashiach will save alive a remnant of Israel even from the race of Adam who will continue into the millennial kingdom.
And so it is, that I provided what was impossible for the race of Adam to provide for his own salvation because the race of Adam could only find full redemption in the blood of the lamb. Because it is I, Yahweh, the Great I AM who provided your perfect Passover even once, now, and forevermore and for all time is his sacrifice accepted, therefore, there is no more need for sacrifice, O’ Israel.
As it is written in Hebrews, even so I say again to you now: For if the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? And so I counsel you, O’ Israel, accept my sacrifice because there remains no more sacrifice for sin!
So understand Israel, that it is impossible for anyone to approach The Everlasting God of Righteousness through Moses any longer, because, I have made Yeshua HaMashiach the way, the truth, and the life of which no man may come to Yahweh except by Yeshua HaMashiach!
And I have commanded your obedience to his voice, even through the Torah where the very voice of Moses cries to this day as a witness against you and in your unlearned and faithless ways instead of obedience you instead ignorantly seek to re-establish a man made temple, as you are led astray by Esau! Because you have rejected the temple built by your creator, even a temple made without hands, even the very temple made by Yahweh himself for the Israel of God of which Jesus the Christ is the chief cornerstone. Therefore, cease from your own works and rest in the works of your true Messiah and I will give you Sabbath.
So I command you O’ Israel and I am the one who gave the very Words spoken by Moses to your Father’s at Sinai, of which Words I do command your obedience always and forevermore even in your willful and hardhearted disobedience. And so Moses said for the obedience of all: The Lord your God will raise up unto you a Prophet like unto me, from among you, even of your brethren: to him you shall hearken!
Whereas Moses was the mediator of the first Testament (engraved by my finger on Sinai) given to convict sin in the flesh, of which Testament now shines in the face of Jesus Christ, even Yeshua HaMashiach who

The BITTER SWEET

is your true Lord and Messiah! And yet the Law of Moses is a shadow of things to come of which things are fulfilled in Christ Jesus and I have made him a life giving spirit and after the flesh Jesus the Nazarene is known no more!
And as it was accomplished by my mighty hand, even the very finger of YHVH the great I AM, did I engrave my statutes in tables of stone on Sinai where I gave Moses my statutes that Israel may yet live before me. Yet, what was given to Israel on Sinai was rather the condemnation of sin in the flesh that Israel would have a schoolmaster to bring them to their true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach whom I have sent for your full salvation.
And so it is, the law of Moses is good, and just, and perfect, and holy and should any man curse the law of Moses let him be judged thereby in the full severity prescribed under the curse and penalty of the law of Moses. And yet what is good and just and perfect and holy worked death to all those condemned therein by sin in the flesh, because where there is no law sin is not imputed, wherefore the law of Moses is given to reveal and convict sin in the flesh.
And yet it is by the spirit of the law and not the letter that mankind finds mercy in my love for them, because the letter of the law brings severity (Have you not read I would have mercy over sacrifice?) and so in my love for the children of Israel whom I intend to yet save should you be obedient to Yeshua HaMashiach, I prescribed sacrifice because without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. And so by the watchful hand of Moses my people have been kept until Christ, although many of you have turned to false gods and love your black cubes, which things are utterly detestable in my sight, O’ Israel, therefore depart immediately!
So understand my anger against you O’ Israel, because I AM YHVH, the great I AM even he who is The Almighty Everlasting God of Righteousness who faints not and neither is there anything too hard for my mighty hand to accomplish. And It is I, El Shaddai, The Almighty God who framed the creation in my eternal wisdom and by the mighty power of my spirit are all things held together in obedience to my voice.
I AM your Elohim, of whom 10,000 times 10,000 surround my throne, even an Angelic mighty host of ministering spirits of which ministers are a flame of fire who excel in wisdom and are brilliantly and perfectly created even as I have created them in my love for them! And in their love for me, they are perfectly obedient to my eternal will and I have given Yeshua HaMashiach rule over them all.
Yet, I YHVH the Great I AM, even he who is surrounded by an innumerable Angelic host needs NO COUNSELOR in my eternal wisdom and of my creation I am sovereign and work ALL things after the counsel of my own will, and of the greatest sages of all eternity there are none wiser than the great I AM! So hear my voice and silence your tongues should you choose to accept eternal life over unquenchable flames of punishment O’ Israel because that is the choice every man must make.
And in my eternal wisdom I sent Jesus the Nazarene to Israel, even when Judea was ruled by Pontius Pilate, even when the chief priests and Sanhedrin unjustly accused him and by wicked hands was the lamb of God slain and crucified even so that the body of sin which binds Adam may be destroyed in all those who obediently live by faith, because the just shall live by faith! And I AM he, even El Shaddai (The Almighty God) who has placed all things in heaven and earth in the mighty hands of Christ Jesus, even Yeshua HaMashiach and he is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah of who I AM sending to judge and make war and for

the salvation of the faithful and obedient. Therefore, hear my Words in obedience to your true Messiah, for there is no other!
So understand my anger against you O’ Israel that in your partial blindness that you inherited from your hard-hearted Fathers, whose Talmudic voice you revere greater than your Elohim. Yes, you hold the traditions of your so-called sages and wise men in greater esteem than the Words of The Great I AM, who is the eternal and everlasting creator of all that has been created! For by YHVH were all things created, which are in heaven, and which are in earth, things visible and invisible: whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were created by me, and for me, And I AM before all things, and in YHVH all things consist.
Yet, you think you are my counselor and foolishly call yourselves my chosen people all the while refusing my Words in faithless disobedience? Oh Israel you have turned aside to dumb idols of the heart and the false words of Esau of whose counsel you prefer over The Everlasting God of Righteousness, even your Elohim! And you stumble about in partial blindness because in Moses your hearts are veiled. Nevertheless, when your heart shall be turned to your true Messiah, the veil shall be taken away and instead of partial blindness you will see!
Who are you, O’ Israel, that you would appoint yourselves Yahweh’s counselor? However instead of the Words of Yahweh given in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach, you have believed the lies passed down in the traditions of your elders who were in bondage to Esau, by whose writings you have bound yourselves to Esau in like fashion and to Esau you are chained! And I did plainly write for Moses to give to your Fathers at Sinai: What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it. And again I had it written in the wisdom of Solomon, of which wisdom stands eternally: Every word of Elohim is pure: he is a shield to those, that trust in him. Put nothing onto his words, lest he reproves you, and you are found a liar.
Oh Israel, that you would bow your hearts in obedience to the Words given for your salvation and eternal joy, should you once again obey the Words of your creator! And I AM he who would restore you and bring you amongst the eternal fold who is under the mighty hand of my Chief Shepherd whom I have given all things! Even Yeshua HaMashiach, who shepherds the true Israel of God perfectly in his obedient love to my voice, even an example you despise. Because Yeshua HaMashiach is the only man ever who perfectly obeys the will of YHVH, the great I AM in whom I am always well pleased, therefore I have made him a life giving spirit so hear him whom I have sent for your sakes because there is no other.
And you have hardened your hearts as hard as The Foundation Stone held captive by the Synagogue of Satan because you have rejected the words of my counsel given in the face of Christ Jesus, whom you ignorantly reject, thereby rejecting your only hope at restoration and salvation eternally and forevermore. And so you stand blind and naked and ashamed in your sin, ignorantly thinking you have become counselor to YHVH, the Great I AM!
So I give you to understand in your partial blindness that you have stumbled at my chief cornerstone your builders rejected, even my rock of offense. Because Yeshua HaMashiach is the chief cornerstone even the true foundation stone, even Jesus the Nazarene whom you reject in willful disobedience though I chose you to myself as a peculiar people and my heart does break

Hear, hear, O’ Israel and understand that I AM he who engraves my eternal law, even an expression of my eternal will in my everlasting plan of redemption that I made after the counsel of my own eternal and perfect will in tables of stone for the obedience of Israel at Sinai! Therefore, I AM he who will write my law on the fleshly tables of your hearts because in my love for you, just the tiniest of my might is able to engrave my law onto your stone tables and with my grace and mercy expressed in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach I will yet smash your tables of stone into the potters’ clay that you may be recreated eternally in righteousness and true holiness even as I swore in my covenants to your Fathers I would do.
Therefore, O’ Israel I do command you to obey the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach because there is salvation in no other name given than Jesus Christ the Righteousness, whom you ignorantly call an idol of the goyim because you are in bondage to Esau!
Yet so it is written and so it has come to be: From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob’s hand held first the heel of Esau. For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that follows. The hand of man is between the heel and the hand. Yet so it is that I will now move to separate Esau from Jacob because Esau is the Synagogue of Satan who are evil tares who have infested the land of promise yet once again, and Israel is once again infested with Canaanites.
And as it is written so shall it be done says the Great I AM: For behold the day comes, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that comes, shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my Name, shall The Son of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings, and shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall.
And as Yeshua HaMashiach gathers the faithful in the Church, even his body, and his bride I will now move Yeshua HaMashiach for the final separation between Esau and Jacob, and Jacob will yet be saved even through the trials of Daniels seventieth week. Therefore, let there be no fornicator, or profane person as Esau, which for one portion of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that afterward also when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place to repentance, though he sought that blessing with tears.
And so mankind is between the hand of Jacob and the heel of Esau, except Esau seeks to give Jacob a head wound of finality, of which I will not allow. And so it is, that all the inhabitants of the earth who are left to Jacob's trouble to endure the refiners fire will either be of Jacob by way of Jesus the Nazarene, of whom are the children of inheritance, or they will be rejected amongst Esau who sold his birthright for a morsel of bread. Therefore, natural man will either call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene until his end so he may be resurrected into the Israel of God or he will likewise sell his potential and eternal inheritance for a morsel of bread given at the hand of Barabbas, for Barabbas will lead The Synagogue of Satan and he is the lamb of the dragon.
And yet so will the trap be set in the land to permanently ensnare Jacob and Barabbas does bring great deception with his rule and much evil will he accomplish both on the land and on the sea. Yet, so will it be that as the fires of war rage and burn that Barabbas will rise even claiming that he is resurrected to fulfill God’s purposes and many blasphemous and evil things will he claim. And he will bring his Olive branch and he will claim himself as Noah, even alive to save the World from judgment intended for evil men.

Because the beast from the earth who is also their false prophet will bring his solution because he is a lamb with two horns who speaks as a dragon. And of a dual nature will his rule be as he will seek to unite all of mankind under the rule of the dragon, who is that devil of old himself. For Barabbas does not come to rule alone though he will claim that he himself is God but he brings a covenant of division where two horns will rule both the sea and the earth, and of the two one is Daniel’s little horn. Yet I have promised that Israel will no longer be divided and of his two states there will never be a solution but Yeshua HaMashiach will unite Israel full and eternally forevermore.
(Yet so shall it come to pass my loves so understand what I will yet accomplish by Yeshua HaMashiach: I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land. And I will make them one people in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two peoples, neither be divided any more henceforth into two kingdoms. Neither shall they be polluted any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.)
The other is the beast from the sea of whom it is written: For he does not desire women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all. I ask you now and see whether a man does travail with child? Yet his wife appears a woman with children, though they are not his children. And the beast from the sea will rise fully united in purpose with the beast from the earth and they do pretend to be enemies who appear divided on ideal and religion.
But they do lie and they do pretend and their father is that same dragon who has made these two evil beasts for his nefarious purposes, even to destroy Adam so he may steal the earth forever for his own and it is impossible that he should accomplish his evil plans because the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, so declares YHVH, The Great I AM!
Because Barabbas brings two states that will be united under the dragon and a false peace will they have as they promise eternal life and health and peace if you will only take their mark and join them as they mingle iron and clay but they shall not cleave one to another. Understand, all of you who would consider joining yourselves forever to the fallen ones by way of their mark that they will tell a multitude of lies saying it is a miraculous medicine that will give life and health and is astonishingly perfect in its design!
But all who take their poison will forever alter themselves forevermore even an alteration of which there is no recovery. Because to blaspheme the image of YHVH of which Adam was created is to join one self to the sins of the fallen ones who pretend they are gods and are not, and all who do have no forgiveness and they have no peace and into that unquenchable lake of fire will they evermore go for so they will have chosen.
Yet, as the unholy three rise so too will my two witnesses, and they will prophecy 1260 days clothed in sackcloth and many testimonies will they give. They will come to Israel and witness of The Everlasting God of Righteousness and will witness mightily of Yeshua HaMashiach even Jesus the Nazarene of whom without no man may come to El Shaddai! Yet, the unholy three will declare Jesus Christ as an outlaw and they will outlaw the holy writings of whom Yeshua is the Word made flesh. Yet the same they seek to outlaw will utterly crush their heads in everlasting defeat.

Therefore, during the days of their testimony if any man’s will is to hurt them fire will proceed out of their mouths to devour their enemies: for if any man’s will is to hurt them then they must be hurt in like manner and if any man’s will is to kill them they must themselves be killed in like manner. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophesying, and have power over waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with all manner of plagues, as often as they will. And so will the days of their testimony be.
And they will speak of many things and they will herald The Everlasting Gospel even the same that has been revealed in it’s time for the fulfillment of all things in the face of Jesus Christ. And their own testimonies they will give and many things will they reveal during the days of their testimony and all will be recorded forevermore. And at the end of their days they must be killed and their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified and they will celebrate much and exchange gifts over their deaths. And at the end of three and a half days they will hear a mighty voice saying come up hither and they will be resurrected alive forevermore and taken again into the heavens and so their testimonies will be finished.
So understand the deceit that has come to your doorstep Israel and understand the choice you must make. You will either accept Barabbas as your false Moshiach and take his mark thereby joining Esau as you liquidate your birthright for a morsel of bread for all eternity, or you will humble your hearts and become obedient to the voice of Yahweh the great eternal God even the great I AM in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach who is the same as Christ Jesus whom I raised from the dead and ascended in to the heavens, and have glorified in eternal splendor and of his rule and Kingdom there shall be no end, and no man may approach YHVH by any other name given whether they be on heaven or earth or under the earth for all time and forever more. Because In Christ will all be made alive and fashioned eternally as one new man forevermore because Christ Jesus is the last Adam.
And they will make war with the saints and they will overcome them for power is given for them so to accomplish. But they will not overcome Israel, no a remnant of Israel is to be saved when they turn to Yeshua HaMashiach with their entire hearts.
Therefore hear my Words O’ Israel that you may yet live before me and I will gather you to myself under the mighty authority of your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach. And it is written: Notwithstanding it cannot be that the word of God should take none effect: for all they are not Israel, which are of Israel: Neither are they all children, because they are the seed of Abraham: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: That is, they which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God: but the children of the promise, are counted for the seed.
I AM Y HVH, the Great I AM and I AM calling you Israel so that a faithful remnant will come to Yeshua HaMashiach that he may save you from the trap that Barabbas is working to set in the land for the final destruction of Jacob, even a destruction that I will not allow.
I AM h e who sends these Words by the voice of one crying in the wilderness, who was redeemed from the gentiles by Christ Jesus and set apart for our eternal purposes, and to Yeshua HaMashiach does he serve YHVH, The Great I AM, because no man can come to me by any other name, not even by my beloved Moses alone, because Moses demands obedience to Jesus the Nazarene!

And all of Israel who call on Yeshua HaMashiach will regain their sight and will see fully, even in the face of Jesus the Christ, your everlasting Messiah!
I AM t he Almighty God of Abraham, and Of Isaac, and of Jacob and I do come to fulfill all or my promises many times over and I will do so wholly by the eternal works of my beloved Son of whom I do command your full loyalty, faith, love, and obedience, O’ Israel unless you intend to sell your birthright, joining Esau by default in those eternal flames of punishment and recompense of justice.
Understand, O’ Israel that the earth will know that there is a God in Jacob and that the God of Jacob is forevermore and eternally Yahweh, even the Great I AM and it is in Christ Jesus that the Israel of God will be gathered and I will gather them to myself just as promised. That whether they be near or far, or whether they be Judean or gentile that all may be gathered in Christ who are heirs of eternal life and who are the true children on promise because the children of promise are the just who live by faith.
And so it will be and YHVH has so declared and all will be yea and Amen and AMEN.

Behold! The Lamb of God!
NOVEMBER 16, 2024
Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach and bow your ears to the sounds of my Words and circumcise your hearts to receive your true Messiah O’ Israel and understand my speech so you may be wise in your ways, and that you may yet allow me to redirect your feet and alter your path from that wide path of destruction of which you follow, to the narrow way of salvation that are my ways and of which I am. Because I am he who Yahweh sent for your salvation, and I am the promised seed of the woman who will crush the head of the serpent, and I am calling you to myself my brethren, even my kinsman of whom I am kinsman redeemer. So I command you to circumcise your hearts and cease your fruitless arguments that you may bear fruit in your trueMessiah so hear my instructions that are given for your obedience that you may yet live before Yahweh the Great I AM even by accepting me as your eternal Messiah of which truly, truly: I am.
And even as Yahweh sent the law of Moses to your Fathers (of which law is your school master intended to bring you to Christ), so too has Yahweh sent me as promised of old where he promised salvation to the Father’s of whose children I now address, even the children of Israel who I love with an ever-burning love. Yet in ignorance and faithless unbelief was I rejected of your Father’s and given into the hands of sinful men to do with great cruelty and malice those things of which the law forbade them to do; and also that they may yet appear righteous to the people of the land when they murdered the lamb of God with your Father’s consent, even a crime which many of you still foolishly consent.
Yet, understand Israel that I was not taken by force by my enemies and by your enemies. Understand, that I was neither taken by force, and neither by craft and no weapon that is formed against me can prosper, for so has Yahweh declared and what Yahweh declares can no one change! Indeed, Israel, I am he who said to Judas Iscariot when I was betrayed by his hand for thirty pieces of silver, this that you do, do quickly! For the price due to a slave owner who had a slave gored by an Ox was my life sold into the hands of those who pierced me, given even by the hands of the chief priests and Sanhedrin who I did confront for their evil and hypocritical ways. And so Judas betrayed me into the hands of Esau, even he who has laid claim to the land of promise yet once again by force, even a claim Esau sold for a morsel of bread. And yet, I willingly allowed myself to be taken by my enemies when I could have easily escaped, and truly, truly, had I prayed to Yahweh, he would have given me command of more then twelve legions of Angels, but how else then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, and so it was finished.
Yet, so it is, that my purposes and ways have been misunderstood by my own kinsman and those of my own nation that I love eternally with a deep and burning love that cannot be quenched nor conquered, because I am your Rock of Foundation without which no builder may build, and at which the faithless stumble. Because it was in my love for you, and all of Adam who is overcome of the fallen ones, that I willingly gave myself into the hands of my enemies to redeem you from the curse of the law.
And so is my eternal commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love than this has no man, when any man gives his life in sacrifice for his friends, which I willingly did knowing that without my obedience to my Father’s will mankind could be cast away forevermore. And I am Adam’s

savior even he who has redeemed mankind from his fallen state should any man come to me on bended knee and confess me as their Lord and indeed I am your true Messiah O’ Israel.
Understand my brethren, that I made no claims of myself that had not been written by the finger of Yahweh on stone tables and stated in the mouth of his servants the prophets to be recorded for the faith and obedience of the heirs of promise, of whose you are O’ Israel, if you will yet harden not your hearts as your Father’s did in the wilderness in their provocation against Yahweh, and in the wilderness did their faithless lives come to an end in utter futility, and they themselves did not inherit the promises but the children of faith!
And yet in your partial blindness you believe the lies of Esau that I am a deceiver and of course I was rejected of Esau because Esau seeks to lay claim on an inheritance that he sold to the younger and there is no path of repentance for Esau, though he sought one with tears. And your Father’s did not understand my true purposes because they sought a worldly leader to overthrow those whom they pledged themselves in subjection even so they could maintain their positions amongst the people. Yet, I was sent to deliver mankind from the hand of the fallen ones who Adam foolishly joined in his disobedience to Yahweh’s command because of the wiles of the serpent who deceived him and the mother of all the living when they sinned at Eden in the beginning. And though many nations have risen and fallen, and many empires have risen and fallen since the times of my sacrifice, Israel is still in bondage to their enemies even to this very day and serves the purposes of Esau, who seeks their utter destruction.
Yes, Israel has remained in bondage because your nation was taken from you in chastisement for killing the innocent blood, even willingly and maliciously killing the very sinless man sent of Yahweh for your redemption. Even me, Yeshua HaMashiach, when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, and made under the law, That he might redeem them which were under the law. And in my sinless life and obedience did I present myself as the lamb of God in agonizing and brutal sacrifice when I offered myself as high priest forevermore after the order of Melchizedek.
And of which mission is completed and I am sat down at the right hand of my Father, even Yahweh, the great I AM. And I have inherited all things, and into my mighty hands are all things given in heaven and earth until my enemies be made my footstool but of my Kingdom there shall never be an end! Of which Kingdom where your King will rule surely approaches at the end of Jacob’s trouble where I will obliterate the enemies kingdom and bring great judgment and consequence on the fallen ones and into punishment will they go for their sins which are many and their judgment eternal of which there will never be a moments rest. And some of them will go into that great lake of fire and burning brimstone at my second coming to rule the earth when the beast and the false prophet are cast alive therein. And the Satans will be bound in that great chain wherewith they will be bound in torment and utter terror as they are bound in expectant horror for what awaits them in their eternal inheritance of punishment forevermore. Even a terrible sentence of which Satan can never escape where he is bound and cast to the hottest fires forevermore at the end of his little season.
Because, I am he who was given for the salvation of Jacob, even the promised seed of the woman of which Adam believed in hope, and he will be raised to newness of life into all eternity. Because I am he who is sent for the redemption of Adam, and I gave my last drop of blood that was spilled and soaked in by the red earth at Calvary, even where I uttered those everlasting words It is finished. And so it is, that I am he who

in my love for Yahweh and my love for my fellow man gave himself in sacrifice in utter agony, shame, and torment and I have conquered sin and death and the day approaches where every evil thing will be no more.
And I did so willingly, even voluntarily for the glory that was set before me and I did so despising all shame that was not mine to carry. Yet in my love for you, I took your shame and punishment on my back, even as they ripped my flesh from my bones with their scourges. Yes, I took your shame and punishment in the abuse and hate of sinful men who were moved by the fallen ones themselves as they ignorantly executed me in your place not understanding in their brutish ways that by killing the lamb of God they were sealing their own fates to the fires for all eternity because it is impossible that death can hold me, because I have never sinned not once, not ever, and truly I never will!
Yes, Israel, I took your place in punishment and the place of your Fathers who ignorantly rejected me at the bidding of Esau! Yet how else could you be redeemed except by their faithless betrayal because to redeem Adam only sinless blood could fulfill the requirements of penalty demanded by the eternal and just laws of Yahweh because without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. And since Adam was created sinless and perfect on the day he was created, so too was I, Yeshua HaMashiach (who is the lamb of God) created perfect and sinless for the full redemption of mankind. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling them that are unclean, sanctifies as touching the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ which through the eternal Spirit offered himself without fault to God, purge your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?
So I give you to understand that I took your place in condemnation and punishment, and did so willingly and without constraint; although I prayed in the garden of Gethsemane if there be any other way, but not my will but Yahweh’s be done. And so in my disgrace, I was taken outside the gates of that great city, (even Jerusalem, who kills the prophets) where I was sent to my own, and there were my garments parted as they cast lots! Yes, there at Calvary, after I had already endured hours of unending punishment of which I was innocent, I was there crucified by the hands of sinful men, of whose sins I had neither part nor lot not even in the least. Yet I willingly and voluntarily was tied and nailed through my hands and feet to hang on that rugged stake in your place, even a punishment that was not mine to bear. For when has it ever been given to the innocent to voluntarily adorn in shame a tree of contempt in utter disgrace and agony for the salvation of his unrighteous brethren to suffer in their place, and yet in my love for you I did just that. Understand that at any time I could have stopped them by asking my Father and he would have given me more than 12 legions of angels at my command, and yet, I never asked but instead chose to endure fully and willingly your punishment that was not mine to bear. And so in my love I gave myself for you, and would do it again, even though such a thing is not necessary and Yahweh has accepted my sacrifice once, all, and for all eternity, therefore there remains no more sacrifice for sin.
Therefore, Israel, understand the love, long-suffering, grace and mercy that I am showing you in your current state of rebellious rejection of your true Messiah, and I am coming to you in this last time in my love for you that is still undying and unconquerable, if you will yet only accept your true Messiah. Because I am he who willingly took your place amongst the condemnation, punishment, and execution of sinners because the wages of sin is death, and yet I am sinless forever, and I always do my Father’s will, even an example you reject in your willful disobedience to Yahweh, and in your rejection of your true Messiah.

to let me go and spoke truly of my accusers, even those of Esau who corralled your Fathers to shout to him release to us Barabbas! Even as they shouted nearly in the same breath “Crucify him!”, in regard to Pilate releasing to themselves their true Messiah and the innocent blood of which they refused. For he knew, well, that for envy they had delivered me. Also when he was set down upon the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream by reason of him, and so it was and so it is written in the holy writings if you will yet find the faith to believe my testimony.
And all because your Fathers desired the things of this earth and loved their positions amongst the people where they could live off the tithes and offerings of the people and stand as self-righteous false oracles where they rehearsed the wisdom of Esau in the people’s ears even spurious wisdom that their elders prized so much more than the voice and wisdom of Yahweh, the great I AM, of whom they rejected when they rejected and crucified to themselves Jesus the Nazarene.
And so it is, that in your rejection of me, even Jesus the Nazarene, I turned to the gentiles, and they did hear my voice for a season and many, many who otherwise had no hope, have now come to salvation in their Lord even a great multitude that I will raise alive to myself to present to Yahweh at the great gathering of the saints that is about to take place. And many from Judea and many who were scattered abroad have been sealed for full salvation. And of your brethren, even those from the northern kingdom who are marked for eternal salvation, even many of those are now sealed eternally and forevermore and will be raised to newness of life. Truly, truly, all of these have left an example of repentance for you to follow, should you obey the voice of the only true Messiah Yahweh will ever send, even Jesus the Nazarene your true Messiah!
Because on account of their sins were the northern tribes scattered amongst the nations, where they have been preserved and kept for salvation, even by Yahweh’s mighty hand. And yet so it is written by the hand of my Apostle Paul when he addressed the Romans these many jubilees past: We know that all things work together for the best unto them that love God, even to them that are called of his purpose. For those which he knew before, he also did predestinate to be made like to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren. Moreover, whom he predestinate, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified. And so in the Israel of God will the gathering of the lost tribes be accomplished, and many Israelites came to salvation by confessing me as their Lord, even Jesus the Nazarene, during my age of grace and salvation they have achieved.
Although you currently hold my works in contempt, even my works of salvation that I have accomplished in the nations at Yahweh’s command during my age of grace that has now come to its end; so understand what Yahweh has cleansed by way of Yeshua HaMashiach’s blood, do not call common or unclean! And I, Yeshua HaMashiach do implore you to follow the ways of your brethren whether they be near or far who have come to me in full repentance so I may receive you to myself and restore you to Yahweh, because he that has the son has also the Father but he who has not the son has not the Father either, and so has Yahweh declared!
And so it is that I turn to my kinsman once again even as I turn away from the nations in this last time of finality and a final separation will now occur during Daniel’s seventieth week, that has arrived to purify the world in my refiners fire and Esau shall be separated from Jacob permanently and forevermore. Because Esau sold his birthright, and Yahweh has forevermore accepted his choice that it may be an eternal choice,

because the children of promise are heirs of the promises and not the children of the flesh, if you are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs by promise. And so it is that the promises of inheritance made by Yahweh himself were made in faith to those they were made, because the just shall live by faith! And after the faithful promises were given so to were covenants made and tokens of promise were given and covenants became testaments by the shedding of blood and all the covenants of old and all of Yahweh’s promises from least to greatest have been included in my New Testament of promise, wherein the creation shall be made righteous forevermore in eternal restoration to the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.
And so I come to my kinsman in love and lowly humility, and I do come to you willingly in my love for you not wishing any of you should perish in faithless unbelief. And truly, truly a remnant will be saved alive from Jacob even during Jacob’s trouble which is Daniels’s seventieth week. Therefore, I implore you my brethren hearken to the sound of my voice because this is the last time and this is the final separation before wrath is poured out in full and before I come to destroy the enemies kingdom completely, because in righteousness I do come as the Lion of the tribe of Judah and I do come to judge and make war!
And all who will turn to me during this time, O’ Israel, even all I command who are born of the fathers of old to hearken to my voice, and also even all who will call on my mighty name to the end from the nations will yet be saved and will be saved in their own orders. The nations will receive similar honor as myself when I gave myself for the sins of mankind, and they will be martyred as they call on my saving name to the end. And into great glory they will go eternally and their rewards are everlasting for their stand, and by their obedience will they have overcome their faithless and lukewarm ways, even so as yet by fire.
And of Israel, my brethren, I will yet come to save you and I will come to your aid with my 144,000 even those who have purified themselves fully as my over-comers in my atoning and redeeming blood in their day of salvation and they will be gathered to me at that great gathering that is about to happen suddenly on the earth. For I will lead my 144,000 to descend onto Mount Zion, and they will follow me step by step as they lead my remnant of Jacob to safety in the wilderness where a place is prepared by Yahweh for their safety, and they will be fed and cared for and the dragon, the beast, and false prophet will touch them not, neither find them, of which remnant you are O’ Israel. But Barabbas will bring the abomination of desolation and many tares will be cleansed from the land, and I will hide my remnant away from the battle of that great day, even the day of my second coming of which day Yahweh has marked in eternities past and is set eternally in his timetable of salvation and that day surely approaches, for so it is written and so shall it be done.
Therefore, my kinsman whom I love eternally and forevermore, and yet I still respect your God given right to choose for yourselves which path you will walk. Therefore I ask you, will you remain on that wide path to destruction that leads to the unquenchable flames intended for the fallen ones? Or, will you obey the voice of your true Messiah, even he who gave every last drop of his own sinless blood in utter torment and agony that you might live before your God, even Yahweh the Great I AM? Yes, Yahweh who has shed many tears in his heartbreak for the lost sheep of the house of Israel, even all those who refuse his voice and my voice. Will you yet join me by your obedience to your true Messiah? Or will you willingly join Barabbas who Esau has sent for your destruction?
So hear my Words O’ Israel and understand the choice you have to make and understand that I am drawing

you to myself and I will send my two mighty witnesses and I do command you to hear them so you may receive their testimony for they will testify of many hidden things that have been concealed from the hearts of men but of which they will reveal and their testimonies will stand eternally and forevermore. Therefore, hearken to the voice of the true lamb of God, O’ Israel for there is salvation and redemption in no other name ever given, and truly, truly no other name will ever be given for this purpose, except Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Jesus the Nazarene although after the flesh I am known no more and I am Christ Jesus even he who is Lord of Lords and King of Kings.
I am the Lion of the tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.
I am he who has sent these Words by my servant and by my servant have these Words been sent, and I do testify and certify that the Words of The Everlasting Gospel that have been revealed by my own hand, and indeed by Yahweh himself, are true, and eternal, and my servant has spoken faithfully the Words that have been revealed to him in their time and they will be preserved through the coming calamities and will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those to whom they are sent.
I am your everlasting and eternal Messiah who longs for your salvation and redemption Israel, and truly, truly I am prepared to receive to myself any and all who respond to the sound of my voice and you will go into the millennial Kingdom and a peculiar people will you be and you will live lives eternal and you will find eternal pasture amongst the Israel of God, and never again will you be separated from the righteous rule of your King, Lord, High Priest, and Messiah and forever more will you be led in peace and righteousness and you will grow as calves of the stall.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I am that the great I AM has made me and I am the Lamb of God given as your perfect and sinless passover forevermore and for all time.
Which lamb will you choose, O Israel?

Behold! The Lion of the Tribe of Judah!
NOVEMBER 17, 2024
Unstop your ears, and allow me to open your eyes, O’ Israel and awake from your partial blindness and hear the voice of your true Messiah, even the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, for so I am. So understand the words of Yeshua HaMashiach, even he with whom you also have to do, O’ Israel, for so I am.
Truly, truly, hear my words my brethren that you may understand the times you live and that you may understand the hope of your calling that is returning to the land of promise, for I am the hope of your calling, and I am calling you O’ Israel so you may understand what is to come and also the wrath that is to be unleashed in these times in which you live. And I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war, so understand the severity of my Words, even the Words of he with whom you also have to do for so has Yahweh made me to be.
Because I am that rock of offense, even that great stumbling stone where all the faithless shall stumble, because the just no longer live by Moses but the just shall live by faith! Because Moses lives in your true Messiah even he who perfectly kept the very law that is impossible for Israel to keep, and even all of Adam to keep because of sin in your corrupted flesh. And I am he who paid the penalty of Moses when I offered myself as the lamb of God to Yahweh in eternal atoning sacrifice because the penalty of sinners was not mine to pay, yet in my love for Yahweh, and my love for mankind I paid your penalties in full. Even penalties of great torment, agony, and death did I pay in full and Yahweh has accepted my sacrifice forevermore.
So understand, the wrath of the Lamb is about to be unsealed and the trumpets are set to blow, and behold, the vials of the indignation of the wrath of God surely approaches and is at your doorstep, therefore, hear my voice that both you and your children may live and escape the trap that Barabbas works to set for my people, even the lamb of the dragon who has been selected by Esau as their Moshiach, who is also a beastly temple builder. And he will rise as a lamb with two horns, and he does come to divide the lands even further from the rightful inhabitants who have been displaced by their genocide, to divide amongst the squatters from Esau who have laid false claim, and the invaders sent by the dragon who are the descendants of Ashkenaz and not Jacob but have yet joined themselves to Esau with their Talmudic ways.
And I am he who Yahweh did send as the lamb of God, even as a perfect peace treaty, even as your perfect Passover and even the final sacrifice for the sins of mankind once, all, and forevermore and there remains no more sacrifice for sins. And I did come to my own in love and peace, even of whom rejected my sacrifice, and yet I am sent as the perfect Passover in obedience to the will of Yahweh, and I am the lamb of God, of which Yahweh provided perfectly for your sins, therefore hear my voice O’ Israel and understand that I will no longer come to the earth as the lamb of God, and peace is to be taken from the earth in judgment that has come. Even of which judgment is to be suddenly unleashed first on the house of God because judgment begins at the house of God.
Because the faithful in Christ will be taken into the heavens, and the lukewarm will be left to the refiners fire for the destruction of the flesh, even so that the spirit may be saved yet so as by fire. And many, many multitudes will come to Jesus the Nazarene from all nations and kindred and tongues and I will purify

them in righteousness and I will receive them to myself and will recreate them in righteousness and true holiness and of their reward there is no comparison to the sufferings they will endure, because the weight of their reward will far surpass the expectations of men and eternally will they ever live in perfect peace and holiness and true righteousness.
For it is written of them and so will it be: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their long robes, and have made their long robes white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, are they in the presence of the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple, and he that sits on the throne will dwell amongst them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, neither any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall govern them, and shall lead them unto the lively fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
So understand that I am he who has completed my works amongst the gentiles and my times of grace and mercy have come to a close, though grace and mercy are forever with me, and Yahweh himself has declared that he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, so grace and mercy truly endure forever. Truly, truly, I went to the gentiles even as an exile rejected of my own who have been taken by Esau in bondage to his blasphemous traditions of which they seek to corrupt the eternal and everlasting Words of Yahweh, of which corruption is impossible. And yet they fabricated their infernal beliefs at the hands of their scribes who codified the traditions of wicked men into a supposed holy book, but how can a book of blasphemy be holy? Truly, truly, woe to them who call darkness light and light darkness, for their judgment lingers not!
And my times amongst the gentiles have come to an end because they have fallen to the same sins your Fathers fell when they rejected the lamb of God whom Yahweh sent to them undeservedly as an eternal peace treaty to the nations, of whom a great multitude has come to salvation. And now those who could have become the children of promise amongst the Israel of God have boasted themselves against the natural branches even of the natural Olive tree to which they were grafted in place when the natural branches were cutoff in the same unbelief.
And yet they were taken from a wild olive tree, even a tree with no hope nor promise and of those who came to me and made me their eternal Lord of righteousness in times of peace, grace, and mercy are now adopted into the Israel of God and fully partake of the promises made to the Fathers and many of these will serve me eternally as my body and I will take them to myself as my bride and I will seal my 144,000 who have purified themselves in my atoning blood as pure as virgins who are undefiled by the great whore. And by salvation of the gentiles were the nations blessed and indeed those of the lost tribes who obeyed my voice have come to salvation in their Lord and they will live eternally amongst the tribes in the Israel of God! So understand, I will save some of all from Adam from wherever he wandered on the earth in his days of chastisement.
Because Yahweh has made me a life giving spirit, and after the flesh am I known no more. Truly, truly, I am he who has now cut off the wild olive tree because of their unbelief and because they have broken my covenant, even my New Testament. And that because they are to have one lord, even me, Christ Jesus the Lord of Lords and King of Kings and in my lordship is their only hope. And yet they have taken to themselves false hope in Barabbas and foolishly placed their hopes in a false lord who invaded their Churches with false hopes of material prosperity, even a false Savior who promises to save Secret Babylon but who secretly works for Secret Babylon’s destruction. Even the same pretender who is the beast from the

earth who will rise as Esau’s false Moshiach, even the lamb of the dragon who will rise having two horns. And so my infiltrated Church of Laodicea have erred and are now consenting to their own deaths, for Barabbas only brings death, and he will utterly decimate and destroy that great whore, even Secret Babylon, whose judgment has come on account of her utter wickedness and depravity with which she has corrupted the earth in her fornication.
So they have rebelliously chosen to themselves even he who brings their destruction as their pretend savior, because the Synagogue of Satan are pretenders who all pretend. So learn, O’ Israel, just what Barabbas is about to accomplish because he has sold them into the hands of their enemies, and he will fake his own head wound and hide himself away in the earth from the calamities about to strike. And he will rise in great deception as a false Moshiach to Israel because they will have their war, even their third such war, and the worst of the three will it be. Even so, for so it is written and so shall it be done: And I saw a beast rise out of the sea, having seven heads, and ten horns, and upon his horns were ten crowns, and upon his head the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his throne, and great authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered and followed the beast.
And so it is that the words in scripture do reveal his treachery, even the Words I gave to John the Revelator these many jubilees past. And it will appear that Barabbas will receive a head wound, but he will lie and fool the world that will fully believe his lying signs and wonders for so is given him to draw all those who have pleasure in unrighteousness to himself in strong delusion, for he is their defiler and destructor. And in his hands he does bring the serpents bite, even that beastly jab, and they will mingle iron and clay though they shall not cleave one to another, yet so the lamb of the dragon will rise. And he will rise atop the fallen one’s final beast system, which will be their final empire to rule the earth from the land of promise. Yet he will not rise alone, but he will rise along with the beast from the sea, and they will rule their alliance of kings who have given their full power and authority to the dragon because they all worship the dragon and to him are they fully dedicated because he is their Father, even he who has planted his evil tares amongst Yahweh’s wheat, and I will utterly root them out and cast them to the fires.
And so will the lamb of the dragon rise in full deceit and many lying signs and wonders will he display to prove his false prophecies, and he will make many boastful and blasphemous claims of himself even claiming he himself is God. And the one beast will point to the other and a tandem rule will they have, even according to the plans of the dragon with which he will rule his evil kingdom for a short time. And they will make all things of Christianity illegal, and they will outlaw the holy writings, and it is given into their hands to make war with the saints and overcome them, and so will they accomplish. Yet they will merge the worlds religions so that all will worship their black cubes because at Satan’s feet have they united themselves in final rebellion and they will not escape my mighty hand, says your eternal Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach!
And yet in their hate for all things pertaining to Christ Jesus they will cause salvation to come upon a great multitude of whom they will martyr, even those who will call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene to their final breath and I will strengthen them and give them great hope, and they will come to me fully, even all those who are heirs of eternal salvation, and no one is able to pluck them from my hands and all those

whose names are written in the lambs book of life will be saved. So fret not for your loved ones who appear lost, because many of them are in my mighty hands and I will yet bring them to salvation in Christ Jesus and in whatever language they call on my mighty name I will hear them!
Yet, so it will be that a false lamb with two horns will rise to rule the world from the promised land Esau seeks to lay claim as his own, but his claims are spurious and Jacob’s birthright is sure forevermore, even which birthright Esau sold for a morsel of bread. Because Esau has joined himself to the fallen ones and has joined himself to Ashkenaz who have taken to themselves the very rites and practices of the evil Canaanite and yet they do lie and claim they are of Israel when they are not. Because it was Canaan who lusted after the ways of the fallen ones after the great flood, thus forever altering his posterity into eternal damnation because all who alter themselves genetically from the image of God of which image they were created have no forgiveness because these are the ways of Satan that Esau has codified in part in his blasphemous Talmud from where his deception springs.
And so Ashkenaz, who is of Japheth, has joined Esau in his false claims of inheritance, wherewith they seek to steal Jacob’s inheritance from the children of promise. However, such efforts are futile and will not stand because I am he whom Yahweh has given all things into my mighty and capable hands. So understand that I am he who has inherited all things promised to Jacob and I am your true Messiah, and in my hands are your rewards O’ Israel and in the hands of Barabbas your eternal destruction awaits, therefore join him not!
So understand that the rewards of promise made to the Fathers of old rest firmly in my hands and no one is able to steal what is rightfully mine for so is the power given me by the great I AM and I will give this inheritance to the children of promise, even the just who live by faith in the Son of Yahweh, who loved them and gave himself for the eternal salvation of the children of promise, therefore O’ Israel accept me as your Messiah that you and your children may live and prosper in the way. And I will keep and preserve you that you may come to your full lot of inheritance in my millennial kingdom that is at your doorstep. So hear my call, O’ Israel! For I am calling you to submit yourselves to my mighty hand that you may also become the children of promise because Moses is kept fully by faith in me, Yeshua HaMashiach, therefore, rest in my works and cease from your own.
And so Ashkenaz has joined Esau in his false claims, wherewith they seek to steal Jacob’s inheritance from the children of promise. However, such efforts are futile and will not stand because I am he whom Yahweh has given all things into my mighty and capable hands. So understand that I am he who has inherited all things promised to Jacob, and I am your true Messiah, and in my hands is your reward O’ Israel and in the hands of Barabbas your destruction awaits. Therefore, understand the choice you have to make, and he with whom you also have to do, because I am he who is sent by Yahweh for your salvation, even he whom Moses commanded your obedience, O’ my disobedient brethren.
And so as it is written of them and so shall it be fulfilled by my mighty hand, because Yahweh did reveal the truth of Esau to his prophets in the days of their offenses which have been many. For it is written of old: For your cruelty against your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off forever. When you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away his substance, and strangers entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.

So understand O’ Israel that the final separation of Jacob and Esau has come upon you, and I do come to purge the land of promise from the hands of the fallen ones and Esau shall be utterly rooted out, and of Esau it is written: And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau as stubble, and they shall kindle in them and devour them: and there shall be no remnant of the house of Esau: for the Lord hath spoken it. So understand those of Esau who read my Words, what Yahweh has declared can no one change and your end will be one of finality and you will be utterly rooted out and never will you be again.
Because I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war. So hear my Words O’ Israel and hide yourselves from the day that is upon you. Hide yourselves from the man of sin that comes your way, because Barabbas comes with eternal death in his hands offered as a miraculous cure falsely promised to give life eternal. But they will not have lives to live in the second death only continual destruction in the hottest flames of punishment where their worm dies not.
I am he who will break the seals on my scroll of inheritance, even the very deed to the earth that I have purchased in my own atoning blood from the hand of Yahweh himself. And I do come to root out the squatters and all those the fallen ones have sent, and even the fallen ones themselves and their times are at an end. So understand what is to come, Israel, because they will establish their kingdom and they will appear victorious and many lying signs and wonders will they show so they may deceive all who have pleasure in unrighteousness. And they will think they have established the start of their golden age wherewith they lust to establish, because they are of their Father the devil, and the devil is that great dragon, therefore, the lusts of the dragon they will do.
Yet, they will have no golden age but only severe and harsh judgment, of which judgment will commence quickly as my faithful in Christ are gathered to me in the clouds as I make my appearing of which the earth will see. Yet, they will lie and tell the world that enemy aliens have stolen many away from the earth and they will return and the earth must be ready to fight these pretend invaders. Yet in truth they are preparing themselves to the battle of that great day, even the day of my second coming, even a day where the birds of the air will feast greatly on the flesh of their fallen kings of the earth and so will it be.
And as the judgments accumulate, as the seals are broken (the horsemen will ride) and the trumpets will sound and it will happen even as written of John the Revelator and also according to the Words of The Everlasting Gospel that has been revealed in its time that Israel may be readied against the day of their trouble and readied for the day of their salvation, which lingers not. And many will blaspheme the God of heaven for the judgments that are to come upon them and many will not repent, and most will take their beastly jab and mix themselves with technologies they do not understand, because their technologies are for the destruction of Adam so hide yourselves away O’ Israel.
And my two prophets, even my two candlesticks will rise and prophecy many things kept secret from the hearts of men and they will reveal much that has been lost in the writings of old and truth will be made known, and the fallen ones will be fully exposed, and Edom will be laid bare from where Esau arose and all those who have joined themselves in confederacy will be exposed and the truth will be made known. And they will herald The Everlasting Gospel and their testimonies will be added to the holy writings forevermore and for all eternity. And yet even in times of judgment does my grace reign supreme, because instead of swift justice that would swallow up the land of the living, grace and space to repent will be given

before final judgment is set to fall. Therefore, many will come to their everlasting Lord of Righteousness and I will receive them to myself and keep them eternally more for Yahweh’s eternal purposes of which they are saved to accomplish.
And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them, and their bodies will lie dead in the streets for three and a half days. At the end of which time they will rise to newness of life as they hear that mighty voice from heaven who will say in front of them all present Come up hither! And they will be raised and taken into the heavens in the sight of them all.
And as the temple is completed the lamb of the dragon will move to dedicate the temple and yet he will set the abomination of desolation in the holy place and cause the oblation to cease mid-week where he will declare himself God and turn on the people. And the blood will flow mightily, and those who have refused my Words and joined themselves to Barabbas, even a great many of these will be killed even as written: And the Angel thrust in his sharp sickle on the earth, and cut down the vines of the vineyard of the earth, and cast them into that great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
So understand the trap that is being set for you Israel, and depart from the ways of Esau into the arms of your true Messiah and I will save a remnant alive for myself. And so it will come to pass that I will come to the earth on Mount Sion with my 144,000 and I will lead you to a place in the wilderness prepared by Yahweh where you will be cared for and kept alive from the wrath of that great day. Because it will come to pass even as written: The dead which die in the Lord, are fully blessed. Even so says the Spirit: for they rest from their labors, and their works follow them.
And as my flock is taken into their field of safety, the full indignation of the wrath of God will be poured out in full on the beasts kingdom and even all those who dwell on the earth in unrighteousness and it will happen even as written and great agony, and terrible consequence will fall on those who have set themselves in array against the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and great punishment and torment will they endure on account of the vials of wrath that are to be poured out on the earth and so will it be.
So understand who I am, O’ Israel, because you no longer know Yahweh, nor do you follow his ways but you unknowingly worship false gods whom your Fathers knew not, even in the ways of Esau who has joined himself to the fallen ones and the confederacy who have united themselves around their false and highly blasphemous book of lies where they codified the traditions of men over the truth of Yahweh’s everlasting Words of righteousness thereby worshiping and serving the creation instead of the creator, who is blessed forevermore Yea and Amen!
Because:
I am he who brings the full wrath of the lamb and I will exact my wrath on all those who pierced me and all those who stand against me when I come with the hosts of heaven and they will utterly perish by way of the double edged sword that proceeds out of my mouth.

I am Yeshua HaMashiach who does come to judge and make war and in eternal righteousness will my everlasting rule be.
I am he who will utterly crush the head of the dragon who is that old serpent even Satan himself and of his wound he will not recover and never again will his kingdom rise because he is no king and of his punishment is the most severe because at his hand was the creation initially corrupted and many have been taken by his wiles.
I am the Lord of Lords and King of Kings and my wrath is fierce and my judgment has come and the times of Daniel’s seventieth week is about to break across the earth suddenly, even as I suddenly snatch the faithful in Christ to myself in the safety of Yahweh’s throne room where they will know even as they are known, and the bridegroom will take to himself his bride who has readied themselves for their bridegroom in much purification and atonement in the ever atoning blood of the lamb.
Therefore, understand that I am he who will right many wrongs in judgment, and I am he of whom it is written vengeance is mine saith the Lord, and I will repay. And so I will utterly root Esau out of the land of promise and I am he who preserves Jacob’s inheritance in my mighty hands that I have reserved for the children of promise, and of which promises the children of the flesh shall be fully denied.
Therefore, understand my Words O’ Israel and understand what I will accomplish, for it is thus written of Esau and so shall it be accomplished: But you (Esau) should not have beholden the day of your brother, in the day that he was made a stranger, neither should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah, in the day of their destruction: you should not have spoken proudly in the day of their affliction. You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their destruction, neither should you have once looked on their affliction in the day of their destruction, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their destruction. Neither should you have stood in the crossways to cut them off, that should escape, neither should you have shut up the remnant thereof in the day of affliction. For the day of the Lord is HERE, and upon all the heathen: as you have done, it shall be done to you: your reward shall return upon your own head.
Therefore:
O’ Israel, understand the severity of the times that have arrived for your full redemption, even the times where the earth will be fully cleansed from unrighteousness culminating in my second coming to the earth where I will establish the Kingdom of Heaven fully on the earth, and where the earth shall be ruled in the righteousness of my New Testament that I have ratified and sealed in my own atoning blood.
O’ Israel, separate yourselves from Esau, and return to your true Messiah and I will receive you to myself and I will shepherd you because I am the Chief Shepherd who shepherds the flock of Yahweh perfectly in my sinless hands.
O’ Israel, separate yourselves fully from the ways of Esau and return to the holy writings of Yahweh and come fully out from amongst them in word, deed, and practice my children so that you do not partake of their judgments and so that you are not ensnared and taken in Barabbas trap, for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird?

O’ Israel, hide yourselves from the wrath to come and separate yourselves from the way of sinners and I will keep you in the way and preserve you from your own destruction even which destruction comes at the hand of your enemies, even their beastly mark of which none will ever recover.
I am, Yeshua HaMashiach, and I am he who has sent these words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent, and The Everlasting Gospel has been revealed in it’s time and the Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts to all those to whom they are sent.
Behold! My time has come and I am he who will surely come to snatch my faithful in Christ, whether they be living or dead and all the World will know of my appearing, only believe not their lies O’ Israel because my appearing is given as a sign of surety and guarantee of my second coming that will certainly happen even as promised of old, and there is nowhere my enemies can hide that I will not find every last one of them because no one can escape from my mighty hand.
I am he who has been empowered by Yahweh himself to restore the creation to its creator in full righteousness and true holiness and I will do exactly as Yahweh has commanded because I always obey my Father’s voice in full obedience so that every Yod, and every thorn of a Yod may be fulfilled in all righteousness.
I am The Lion of the Tribe of Judah and I do come to utterly crush forevermore the head of that great dragon, even that old serpent whose wiles have corrupted the garden of Yahweh from the beginning, THEREFORE, who can stand against whom the great I AM has empowered and shared his throne, because it is El Shaddai who works mightily by my mighty hand of which he has empowered, and no one can separate me from my eternal purposes, because I am he who will put down all unrighteousness never to rise and rule again.
Behold! I am he who will now move to make my enemies my footstool, and I will force their rebellious knees to bow to my judgments and I do come to destroy the squatters and send them to their punishment and judgments of which they will never escape.
I am he who is coming to exact vengeance on the fallen ones and to deliver Jacob forevermore from their grasp.
And I am he who will restore the creation in peace after the day of trouble and I will recompense the just and righteous according to their works, and forevermore will we go into peace and tranquility where perfect joy and happiness will be had by all, and Yahweh will make his abode amongst men even in that great day when I will have given the subjected kingdom into his mighty hands that Yahweh may be all in all and what a sweet day of unity and consummation that will be.
I love you my countrymen, and I do come to fight for you my loves, therefore, hearken to the sound of your true Messiah’s voice and understand the words of Yeshua HaMashiach, even he with whom you also have to do, O’ Israel, for so I am.
I am The Lion of the Tribe of Judah!

The Lamb and The Lion Become One!
NOVEMBER 20, 2024
Come to Yeshua HaMashiach, my kinsman, and understand the work of your redeemer, for I am your kinsman redeemer. Because I am the one who will yet redeem a remnant of Jacob that they may yet live before the great I AM, even YHVH, the great eternal and everlasting God. And of my rule and of my kingdom there shall be no end, therefore, hearken to the Words of your everlasting Lord of Promise, even Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also Jesus the Christ, who is also Christ Jesus, for so the great I AM has made me forevermore.
And truly Yahweh has given me a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, both in heaven and in earth and even under the earth. Because I am he whom Yahweh has given all things in heaven and earth into my mighty hands for the fulfillment of all things. Therefore, O’ Israel, hear my voice in loving obedience in response to the love I have shown to you by dying in your place in agonizing torment that was not mine to endure. Nevertheless, in my love for you, I took your place that I may redeem you from the penalty of Moses, of which penalty is impossible for you to pay yourselves due to the sin in your flesh. Even indeed for the redemption of Adam was I sent into the world.
Because Moses is just and holy and righteous and Moses truly lives in your true Messiah and everlasting Lord of Righteousness, for so I am. And I am he who perfectly kept the law of Moses by my love and obedience to Yahweh who led me in his undying love for the race of Adam who has been wronged and overcome by the fallen ones, therefore mercy and grace have been given in great abundance in order to hold in abeyance full severity of judgment and wrath that a full and final separation can occur between Yahweh’s wheat and the fallen ones tares, and so all who are heirs of eternal life in Christ Jesus will be redeemed by their choice to submit themselves to Yeshua HaMashiach, who is Christ Jesus, and is also Jesus the Nazarene.
And to the nations did Yahweh send me, and in service to the lost tribes of Israel did I go because I was rejected of my own kinsman in faithless unbelief, even by the chief priests and the Sanhedrin who secretly serve the Dragon because they are of Esau who has joined himself in his hatred of his brother Jacob to Ashkenaz of Japheth, that they may gather to themselves the things that are mine and that they may give Jacob a final head wound of which Yahweh will not allow, even an action that he will disallow by my powerful and ever obedient hand. Therefore, my kinsman, submit yourselves in obedience to my voice that you may yet live before me, and that you may yet live before Yahweh who no man may approach without Jesus the Christ because so has Yahweh chosen in his eternal plan of redemption and wisdom. So understand without your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach you remain dead in trespasses and sins of which I have overcome when I paid in full the penalty of Moses for all time and for all who chose to accept my sacrifice.
And so it is that Moses lives in Yeshua HaMashiach, and I am he whom Moses commanded your full obedience, so hear my words and circumcise your hearts and ears to hear my speech. Because your hearts have become fat in disobedience, and you have filled your ears with the wisdom of Esau and polluted your hearts with their blasphemous, Talmudic lies. Understand that Moses is perfect and just and holy and

should any man call the law of Moses accursed, then let that man be accursed on account of his blasphemy, even by the law of Moses of which he cursed. Therefore, I give you to understand that the law was given to convict sin in the flesh, for where there is no law sin is not reckoned according to law, although sin is present in the flesh just the same. Therefore, by the works of the law of Moses shall no flesh be justified in Yahweh’s sight: for by the law of Moses comes the knowledge of sin.
Yet, as I had Paul write to my Church in my age of Grace that now is the righteousness, of God made manifest without the law of Moses, having witness of the law and of the prophets. Oh, my former oracles who have fallen from your previous lot assigned to your once great nation by Yahweh himself because you were to be a peculiar people separate and distinct from the nations! Yet you have rejected me just the same as your Father’s in your hard-hearted rebellion against the eternal purposes and plans of the Almighty God, even El Shaddai. And so it is by your rejection of my Words given in the gospel of salvation when I revealed the great mystery of God to my holy apostles and prophets you have become as one needing milk, and you are unable to digest strong meat because you are yet babes without full understanding, although you arrogantly count yourself wise sages and beacons of light but you have been falsely enlightened by the fallen ones to lead people astray in your unlearned ways.
Therefore, understand, my kinsman, that the just shall live by faith and that by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified! It is written in the holy writings given by the hands of Paul, who was indeed an obedient Benjamite who was formerly disobedient and stubborn in his rejection of Jesus the Nazarene, even the same as you: So then they which be of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse of the law: for it is written, cursed is every man that continues not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.
Yet, on account of the malice, trickery, and wiles of the serpent on the day Adam fell from on high sin has reigned in the flesh ever since and the corrupted form of Adam is not your home, and neither are you destined to spend eternity in houses of clay of which houses return to the dust of the earth from where your substance was taken. Therefore, Yahweh has made me a life giving spirit, and I am the last Adam. And I am he who is fashioned as a pattern of eternal life that you all may be recreated in full completion and unity, even as one new man. Because there will not be two forms of men eternally but one because the form of Adam is to perish forevermore along with the corruption inherent in corrupted flesh.
Therefore, understand that the fallen ones would hide the truth from you in your current partial blindness and pride, even the truth that will completely liberate you into the liberty wherewith I seek to make you free. So I give you to understand, O’ Israel, (whom I love) that no man is justified by the works of the law of Moses in the sight of Yahweh, it is evident: for the just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith: but the man that shall do those things, shall live in them. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, have redeemed you from the curse of the law, being made a curse for you, for it is written, cursed is every one that hangs on a tree. Therefore, O’ Israel, accept my sacrifice that both you and your posterity may live and so that you may have access to my millennial kingdom that is given as a Sabbath days rest in Yahweh’s eternal plans of redemption for mankind, for a thousand years is as a day and a day as a thousand years in the sight of Yahweh, with whom you have to do O’ Israel.
Therefore, depart from those who lie to you and separate yourselves from that blasphemous book of lies sent by the fallen ones to deceive you and bind you in error for your total destruction. Depart from the

serpents lies and come out from among them, and be ye separate, O’ Israel, and I will receive you to myself and preserve you alive from the destruction of Daniel’s seventieth week, even Jacob’s trouble that is coming to cleanse the earth from the hands of evil doers in great and righteous judgment.
Because the times of separation are fully coming upon the earth where Jacob, whose inheritance is one of promise for the children of promise who live by faith, will be utterly and eternally forevermore separated from his disobedient brother, even Esau who seeks to steal that which he sold in faithless unbelief because he had no respect nor faith in the faithful promises made in faith by Yahweh to faithful Abraham, but instead cared more for the things of the earth being a fornicator and profane person who sold his eternal inheritance and birthright for a morsel of bread.
So I give you to understand the future that I am calling you to partake and of which I will preserve you in the safety of my strength if you will yet submit yourselves to my rule and authority, for in so doing I will restore you fully to Yahweh even the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning. And so it is written in the promises of old and so will it be my kinsman of whom I am kinsman redeemer!
And so it shall come to pass at the end of Jacob’s trouble that I will establish my kingdom in righteousness on the earth, and no evil thing shall enter therein. Understand that I will bring an eternal end to Satan’s kingdom and the dragon will rise to rule no more and the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth will be cast alive into that great lake of fire of burning, rolling brimstone that burns the hottest flames of blue and into that putrid lake of punishment will they be cast forevermore, where their worm dies not for so are they worthy.
Satan himself will be taken and bound in a great chain of torment and punishment where he will wait in fear and distress of his own impending destruction, of which inheritance he will share with all those who follow him. Truly, truly, in the abyss will he remain sealed and bound for the duration of a thousand years, at the end of which time he shall be loosed to gather those who will have rebelled and joined his ways, even his final rebellion that evil may forever more be destroyed in finality of judgment. And at the end of his little season when he shall have gathered them together as the sand of the sea against the camp of the saints on the breadth of the earth fire will fall from Yahweh from on high that will utterly consume and devour them all, and Satan will be eternally bound and cast to his eternal inheritance in those ever burning eternal flames of punishment and that great white throne judgment will commence.
And in that ever burning lake of punishment that burns the hottest flames of torment, even in whose ever burning eternal embrace Satan will utterly pay for every last sin he has ever committed a multitude of times over, and every evil act is recorded perfectly in the heavens and will be given into the flames of punishment as his eternal inheritance. Indeed, every being that has followed and committed themselves to his cause will face the same punishment and they will have no mercy because they have shown no mercy, therefore no mercy will be given forevermore. And as they have done unto others, and as they have harmed Yahweh’s creation so will it be recompensed on their own heads, even as promised of old because not one promise of Yahweh will ever fall to the ground unfulfilled. Truly, truly all those who reject my offer of salvation will be cast to the fires and there is no respect of persons.

However, the fate of the fallen ones that they have chosen and made for themselves in their evil rebellion against Yahweh and his creation is not for you my kinsman, should you accept me as your Messiah. No, to the contrary, are many rewards and blessings laid up for you that you will fully realize in my kingdom that I will rule in everlasting righteousness. There will be one King of Kings and Lord of Lords who will rule the earth in eternal righteousness, even from Jerusalem, even from the throne of David to which I am eternal heir! And of my faithful bride that I will take to myself in eternal covenant will I coronate and consecrate a mighty host of Kings and Priests according as their faithfulness has been and they will rule in righteousness in perfect harmony with their King of Kings and Lord of Lords and we will rule as one.
And the people of the land and the people of the nations will beat their swords into plowshares and nations will no longer war amongst themselves, and the peoples of the earth will not learn to war and fight in my holy kingdom. Even as it is written of the prophets of old: The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie with the kid, and the calf, and the lion, and the fat beast together, and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed: their young ones shall lie together: and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock. And the sucking child shall play upon the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand upon the cockatrice hole. Then shall none hurt nor destroy in all the mountain of my holiness: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters that cover the sea.
And in that day shall there waters of life go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the East sea, and half of them toward the uttermost sea, and shall be, both in summer and winter. And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his Name shall be one. All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon, toward the South of Jerusalem, and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place: from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananiel, to the Kings wine presses. And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more destruction, but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
So understand, O’ Israel what I will do for all those who love me by obedient adherence to my everlasting commandments of life and peace were with I do command you. So understand to love Yahweh is to keep his commandments and Yahweh’s commandments command obedience to the Son of Yahweh, who I am: therefore, kiss the Son lest I be angry and you perish from the way.
Because, mine is a kingdom where my eternal purposes will come together in completion and full consummation as the lamb becomes one with the lion.
Because, I am the Lamb of God, given for the sins of mankind of whose blood is an eternal atoning sacrifice whereby the unrighteous are made white as snow in holy purity.
Because, I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who does fight for you O’ Israel and who will utterly decimate your enemies according as it is written of me; vengeance is mine and I will repay, says the Lord of Lords and King of Kings!
Therefore, understand my purposes and who Yahweh has sent for your redemption and there are many facets to my purposes of salvation. And I am the preeminent one, even he who has won your salvation eternally should you choose to accept my hand of love and accept my new covenant.
Because it is by my new covenant that I ratified in my own blood, wherewith is now my New Testament by which the earth shall be ruled in righteousness! And the knowledge of Yahweh will cover the earth and my

glory will shine from Jerusalem that the nations may gather themselves and enter the holy gates of that holy city that they may learn of Yahweh and that they may live his ways on the earth.
There shall be no more in my kingdom an infant of days, nor an old man, that has not filled his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old: but the sinner being a hundred years old, shall be accursed. And it will be that he who lives to see a hundred years will be as but a babe.
Even so, the earth will be restored to its former glory before the fallen ones polluted the earth with their abominations when they descended on Mount Hermon to make their accursed oath that they may live out their lusts in great sin and rebellion against the orders of life in which they were perfectly created. They will not be present in my kingdom; nor shall the earth be ruled in hateful violence where the strongest survive, for such nonsense is an inversion of Yahweh’s laws by which means Satan always seeks to invert the orders of Yahweh that destruction may reign.
And it is I, Yeshua HaMashiach who will rule the nations with a rod of iron by the hands of many Kings and Priests of whom I will coronate and ordain to the highest service, and they are the first fruits of the dead, and they are immortal never to die again and of their reward is there no end, because they came to me willingly in the days of grace and I gathered them to myself in my body recreated as one new man whether they were Judean or Gentile, whether they were bond or free. They will have many enablements and abilities and attributes given them for their faithfulness because they are my over-comers who overcame all things by the blood of the lamb.
Because it is the Lamb of God who overcame the fallen ones at calvary forevermore and it is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who will utterly subjugate the creation to Yahweh, even so that Yahweh may be all in all when I will present to him the subjected creation because I must reign until all of my enemies are made my footstool, and it is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah that will trample every aspect of Satans kingdom under my mighty and eternal feet.
Wherefore, I am he in whom the lamb shall unite in full peace and unity with the lion because my eternal purposes will be done forevermore and there is nothing and no one who can stand against Yeshua HaMashiach and my times have come where I will reveal myself to the inhabitants of the earth. Behold, I come with clouds, and every eye shall see me: yea, even they which pierced me through: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail before me, even so, Amen.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach who is about to reveal himself to the earth and all the world will know that there is a God in heaven and the ways of Yahweh will fill the earth in holy righteousness.
I am Christ Jesus, your ascended and resurrected Lord, King, High Priest, and Messiah!
I am he who has sent my holy Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have my holy Words been sent! Because my mighty messenger has faithfully returned to his eternal calling after much chastisement, repentance, and purification in my atoning blood; and I have received him to myself in my love for the penitent whoever they may be that come to me with a contrite heart. And to my messenger did I reveal The Little Book that John the Revelator was commanded to seal up so it could be revealed in its time, of which book contains the voice of the seven thunders even all of which is The Everlasting Gospel and he has announced my Words faithfully as commanded, of which testimony John the Revelator wrote and witnessed.

I am he who is no respecter of persons, even Yeshua HaMashiach and any and all who come to me from the race of Adam in such manner I will receive, except those who foolishly take the mark of the beast, or who alter themselves in such manner. Truly, truly all who come to me in such manner who turn to live righteous lives will be rewarded forevermore and the weight of your reward is eternal.
And so it is my kinsman, that salvation is the gift of eternal life, that I Yeshua HaMashiach earned by my faithful adherence to the law of Moses and by my eternal sacrifice of myself as the sinless and perfect Lamb of God. Therefore, all who come to me in full repentance and humility and obedience I will restore to myself and to Yahweh and will give them many righteous works that Yahweh would have them accomplish in his everlasting and eternal purposes. Wherefore, the gift of eternal life is in my hands for all who ask in meekness and repentance and who come to me in the times given for repentance.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, and I do love you my countrymen and I am coming to your rescue and I will save the obedient among you to the uttermost, therefore obey the Words of the great I AM in obedience to your true Messiah, in whom the lamb walks hand in hand with the lion, for truly, I am.
Behold! The salvation of Israel is at hand and the lamb sings in unison with the lion who roars in fierce protection for his cubs, therefore, prepare yourselves O’ Israel because your redemption has come. Hear me in my love for you, my countrymen, because your true Messiah is at hand.

The Temple of Esau.
NOVEMBER 23, 2024
Hear, hear! O’ Israel the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, even the only-begotten son of Yahweh, the great I AM! Even so that I may warn you of things to come, and so that you are further made aware of the trap that Barabbas will set so you are not ensnared with the faithless; of which things have been written before in part in The Everlasting Gospel. Yet I come to tell you of the trap the spider sets in the land of promise and to make it plain so that you are not destroyed by their designs. And I do desire to make your paths plain and keep you in the ways of righteousness, even the ways of Yahweh, even whose ways live perfectly in Yeshua HaMashiach your true Messiah who always perfectly obeys Yahweh’s will. And also so that you may keep your foot on that straight and narrow path, of which I will keep your feet firmly planted if you but continue to follow me in obedient faith. Because the just shall live by faith!
So understand the time has come, even as declared and announced where I will suddenly gather the faithful in Christ into the heavens whether they be living or dead; and as the faithful saints are suddenly taken sudden destruction will overtake Secret Babylon who sits on many waters, which are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And as the ashes of war smolder and the current arrangement of nations is decimated and realigned to suit their purposes, the fallen one’s final beast system will rise in full.
Yet, the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth have played the role of virtuous shepherds who came to shepherd the lost sheep of Secret Babylon with many empty promises; even false promises that ultimately bring death and destruction. And they pretend to be enemies behind the facade of a senile old stooge behind whom they hide themselves and of which stooge is there to take the blame for their crimes; and they do control his every move and script his every word. Because this great deception is given in judgment on Secret Babylon; that strong delusion should overtake her fully because she has covered the earth in her lies having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.
And yet these two evil beasts have spoiled Secret Babylon, even before her destruction has come and have taken her military might and abundance for the dragon’s purposes in their coming final beast system. Because the war that is to come will devour Secret Babylon, and truly she will be destroyed in one hour, for so has been declared of Yahweh, even the Great I AM. Yet, this is by design and is also set in Yahweh’s plan of redemption (that his enemies should obey his voice) and so the great Harlot’s judgment is declared, and written, and so shall it be done forevermore, and never will she rise again. Even so, they will split the earth and great shaking will occur, and they have engineered her destruction that they may gather the resources of which they lust that are buried in the earth. Even the resources with which they need to power and expand the fallen one’s technologies; even wherewith the world is currently mesmerized and enchanted in its strong delusion, kept enthralled to their frequencies and manipulations wherewith they are stimulated and controlled.
And of the people that will remain after the coming destruction of Secret Babylon; the beast from the earth and the beast from the sea have imported an army of invaders and executioners into her borders whose numbers are as a mighty plague of locusts, and they will be unleashed at their signal! Because these are the armies of the beast who have been gathered for Secret Babylon’s destruction. Many of these are from the

lands of the dragon and the lands of the bear, and they will do as Secret Babylon secretly did to them in jubilees past: They will kill every man woman and child with no remorse who does not suit their purposes and many who are allowed to remain alive will be forced into their slave camps to work in their mines to their deaths. And they will toil and labor till their last breath; because all that Secret Babylon has secretly done to others will now be done openly to her in her judgment and punishment. Because Secret Babylon is drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus that she has martyred in great abundance in foreign lands; all the while claiming that she herself serves Jesus the Nazarene. But in truth she serves the fallen ones and her purposes are now over, and they do lust for her destruction so they can cover their crimes and so that their mangy shepherds may appear virtuous when they rise in order to hide their trap.
Yet, they can never hide themselves from Yahweh, nor Yeshua HaMashiach and their crimes are recorded perfectly in the heavens and every sin is recorded in perfect detail along with the thoughts and intents of their polluted hearts. And the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth are evil abominations created for the destruction of mankind. These evil beasts are child molesters, and they collect and use the bodies of the little ones that they have killed to make their abominations and so all they destroy are given in sacrifice to their god. Because they took up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of their god Remphan, figures which they made, to worship them, and much much more have they done that will be revealed fully at the proper times of revealing because every secret will come to light.
So will it be that the beast from the earth will seem to rise as it were from the grave; even claiming that he is risen from the dead, even the very heart of the earth because death could not hold him! And he will have his false resurrection and bring a false peace on the earth to end their war, and he will appear that he has come to save mankind. And the fallen ones will reveal themselves to mankind as benevolent helpers who are far superior in wisdom and advanced in the ways of technology, medicine, and peace.
They will produce many lying signs and wonders, and they will say that those who have been gathered in Christ at the great gathering and taken into the safety of the heavens before great calamity fell; that even these were taken by force by a pretend extraterrestrial enemy. Even a hostile alien force that will come again to destroy humanity, and they will rally natural man to unite with them in order to save himself from this evil they imagine in their pretend universe of ever falsely spinning pretend worlds in an ever expanding void of nothingness.
Even a lying cosmology that the fallen ones imagined and used before in their golden age of old, of which golden age met its end at the hands of Yahweh in the great flood in the times of Noah, of which records are engraven in the holy writings of old. And of which lies will be hurled to the ground because their great deception will be fully laid bare that all may see these pretenders who pretend for who they truly are because they are fallen beings from the heavenly realm who have long since corrupted themselves in pointless rebellion from Yahweh’s righteousness even so that they may inherit their own destruction that they have made for themselves in their inheritance of burning brimstone of which they will never escape.
And so the beast from the earth will rise seemingly from the dead and with many lying signs and wonders will he appear, even with his olive branch in hand. And he will rise as a lamb with two horns as he rises in full power and authority of the dragon even with the beast from the sea, even he who is chosen of the dragon and the beast from the earth for the rule of the nations that he may rule the sea of nations according

to their blasphemous and genocidal Noahide laws. Yet his two states will never be a solution because I am he who will unite Israel forevermore never to be divided into two kingdoms again.
And so they will use their evil statutes and consequences contained in Noahide to make war on the saints and to overcome them, except whosoever calls on the name of the Lord to the end shall be saved, even those who call on Jesus the Nazarene as their saving Lord who will save them if they faint not in their distresses. And so the beast from the sea will be unleashed on what remains of the nations that they will have destroyed, and of whose ashes were nations they once ruled in great deceit. And they will appear to rise as a great phoenix from the ashes and flames of war still smoldering from their deception. And a great war will it be, even the greatest of the three such wars that they have fomented and manipulated; so that the dragon may rise fully in his time with his evil, abominable beasts with which he will have his short rule, never to rule again.
Because the mystery of iniquity has been at work through the ages; where the great whore who sits on seven mountains, even that great scarlet whore of blasphemy who worships the queen of heaven and who teaches another Jesus as part of their pagan trinity. Even whose roots are in ancient Babylon where Nimrod began his fables with the queen of heaven. Of whose legacy and priests and bloodlines trace their lineage to the fallen ones who ruled ancient Babylon with their unholy three with which they use to mock the true godhead, and the promised seed of the woman. These pagan practices and rites have dominated the earth in great secrecy where the initiated priests of the fallen ones secretly worship the sun but claim they are The Society of Jesus; and so has their false and blasphemous pretend church exerted oppression and persecution over the earth during the days the mystery of iniquity spread in secret. Therefore, their destruction lingers not and their times have come!
Yet these two evil beasts, even who currently work hand in hand for the full destruction of secret Babylon, even the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth; even these two who have both been ruling heads of Secret Babylon and who have ruled with many great and empty promises wherewith these two mangy shepherds have shepherded the lost sheep of Secret Babylon promising false material prosperity and abundance to those they shepherd. And in their hands and by their schemes they have surely arranged and will execute what has been given into the hands of the dragon to accomplish.
Because Secret Babylon, even that great whore who sits on many waters is a nation that was made, so these two evil beasts could rise from her ashes in their times of revealing. Even an adulterous nation, even a nation of fornication, a nation that is indeed a great harlot claiming herself a righteous follower of Jesus the Nazarene. But in truth is a nation whose builders are free from the true Rock of Foundation, even that great cornerstone of which the faithless stumble, even Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach. And so these evil builders have made themselves free from salvation and committed themselves to that lake of fire where their worm dies not by rejecting the chief cornerstone and rock of offense and they will not escape!
Yet the fallen ones have always had the same goals in mind and their plans and purposes remain the same. Because they intend to fully destroy Adam from the earth, and they fully intend to destroy Jacob from under the sun even so that they may continue to remain as squatters and unrighteous usurpers of the earth so they can have their golden age of which they lust. But understand their golden age was a time when Adam was overwhelmed and dominated by a worldwide empire of evil abominations which were made for

the complete destruction of mankind, and their abominations will return! But no golden age will they have but only shattered hopes and harsh judgment as the fallen ones kingdom is utterly destroyed before their very eyes by my mighty hand!
And their so called golden age was a time when the righteous line of Seth hid themselves away in the wilderness from their evil society in the world that then was. Even so that the bloodline of Seth could remain pure from genetic pollution and the promised seed of the woman (which I am), could come as promised of old by Yahweh himself. Behold! Yahweh has declared that He will bring Giants to fulfill his wrath, and so it will be. Yet, so will their evil empire rise and dominate the entire earth and many evils will they bring, and many abominations will be unleashed from beyond the ice and from the heart of the earth and the abyss will be opened.
There will be great evil on the earth and even though they will rise to bring false peace; war will ever dominate their rule because peace is to be taken from the earth in judgment at the removal of my restrainer. And peace they will never have because Yahweh has declared of old that the fallen ones have no peace because they have wronged mankind in their evil lusts and hatred of all things made by Yahweh. And they will establish a false peace on the land and the beast from the earth will fully come into his own power, and he will rule as a lamb with two horns who speaks as a dragon.
For the lamb of Esau, even the beast from the earth who is also Barabbas, has been selected as their beastly temple builder and is as the lamb of the dragon for their false Moshiach and pretend king. Truly, truly, he will unite Esau and Ashkenaz and all who join them under the banner of a religion that their Father’s knew not and their Talmudic ways will dominate the earth. They will brutally subjugate the nations under Noahide and will rule the nations with great cruelty and the beast from the earth will cause all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive his mark in their right hands or in their forehead that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Because he does bring the serpents bite of which no man can recover and all who partake will have altered themselves eternally from which alteration they will have no forgiveness, and they will mingle iron and clay, but they will not cleave one to another. That which is crooked cannot be made straight and all who make themselves crooked in such manner will have their portion in that great lake of burning brimstone of unquenchable flames where their worm dies not.
So the beast from the earth who is also their false prophet and false Moshiach will make his declarations and he will build his temple because he is sent as a beastly temple builder who has built himself many towers in his empire dedicated to his own name, and he will speak of himself in great admiration even declaring that he himself is God. For he does come to make many grand promises of which he is powerless to fulfill, and he does come to speak many great and blasphemous things, and so he shall do for so is given for him to accomplish. Because he is a builder and developer who has made to himself many towers and resorts, and truly he sits atop his own empire wherewith he has dedicated in his own honor; because he always praises himself for so are the ways of the dragon who is his true Father.
As his temple is built and finished amongst great fanfare and many blasphemous and false promises, so will he make many false declarations in his office as false prophet and his rule will be fierce and brutal. Yet, he will set his trap but what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird? By great stealth he lays his trap and with great promise will he promise to dedicate his temple for the people of the land and with great excitement

will Esau and Ashkenaz celebrate themselves around the lamb of Esau, and they will pretend they are reestablishing the ways of the Torah, but they are bringing the ways of death which are codified in their book of blasphemous death, even their Talmud. Behold! The beast from the earth is a murderer and leader of seditious rebellion against Yahweh in the ways of Barabbas. He will betray all those he makes his grand promises and with no remorse will his betrayal be and with great hate which he has inherited from his Father, the devil of whose lusts he is bound in iniquity to accomplish.
Yet so is the nature of the spider who has woven the earth completely in its web. The spider sits and waits for its prey to land in its web as it then springs into action to capture, paralyze and cocoon its prey so it may slowly feed on the life of its captives; as they are slowly ingested fully of the evil with which they are ensnared. And yet the masses will come from near and far at the sound of his call; and the invitation of his dedication and purification of his temple will sound out across the earth and many who refuse their true Messiah will be taken in his trap and perish thereby. Yet a trap will it not appear to those he has enchanted, but a revival of Moses led by their Sanhedrin and ruled by the traditions and wisdom of Esau contained in their blasphemous unholy book. And a group of false priests who are not of Levi because Levi is fully found in the High priest of Melchizedek, because I, Yeshua HaMashiach am your High priest forever after the order of Melchizedek, for so has Yahweh declared.
Yet as I taught truth during my time when I came to my own as the Lamb of God; when of my own countrymen was I rejected, yet I taught the truth just the same, therefore, O’ Israel you are without excuse. Although, in my love for you and according to the promises and covenants of old, I come to tell you once again even so that Jacob does not fall to Esau.
For it is written in the holy writings: When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso reads, let him understand). Then let them which be in Judea, flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the house top, not come down, to take anything out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field, return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days. But pray that your flight is not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day: For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elects sake, those days shall be shortened.
As it is written, so shall it be done and Barabbas will spring his trap that he will have cleverly hidden. Because the fallen ones do seek to destroy the race of Adam fully from the earth. Therefore, will they make war on the saints and overcome them, and Esau along with Ashkenaz do seek to ensnare Jacob, even so Jacob may fall to the head wound with which they seek Jacob’s end. Understand that if it wasn’t for the grace and mercy of Yahweh who committed himself in his eternal love for Israel in many promises and covenants of old to deliver and redeem Jacob from the hands of his enemies; you all would perish at the hands of the unholy three! But yet, Yahweh is eternally faithful to every promise he has ever made! And I, Yeshua HaMashiach even he who purchased your salvation by my own agonizing sacrifice is faithful to always and forevermore fulfill every promise of every covenant ever made, and truly every promise that will be made forevermore and so not one promise ever made of Yahweh or Yeshua HaMashiach will ever fall to the ground in unfulfillment but all will be fully fulfilled, forevermore.
Therefore, I will come to the aid of Israel, even those who are from Jacob who will submit to my rule as

their Messiah in Yahweh’s eternal plan of salvation which Yahweh has given for Jacob's salvation; because truly, truly, had the days not been shortened no flesh would be saved alive. For so the fallen ones intend, that they would destroy the saints, and that they would then destroy Jacob, and from there they would exterminate all who remain who are born of the race Adam; so that the earth would then be fully theirs in their delusional plans that come to nothing.
And then shall the greatest tribulation ever overtake the earth and blood will flow over the earth in great quantities. And Barabbas will kill many outside the city of which he will have surrounded with his armies so that they will not escape; and so it is written: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.
So then, the greatest tribulation ever will occur, even a tribulation the likes of which have never been experienced on earth before, and truly, never will be again. Behold! I, even Yeshua HaMashiach, will not leave Jacob to sudden destruction, and I will yet save Israel, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as their true Messiah, for so Yahweh has created me to be. And so will my 144,000 come to the aid of those who would otherwise perish and who call on my name. I will lead them step by step, and my 144,000 will do many mighty works for me, even greater works than I did during my time in sinless flesh as the lamb of God.
For these are those who are taken in the gathering of the saints to me, Christ Jesus, in the air at the sound of the last trumpet, and the trumpet is about to sound. These are my faithful, even those in whom was found no guile, for they have purified themselves as a chaste virgin in the blood of the Lamb; which I offered forevermore as their high priest, for I am forevermore the high priest after the order of Melchizedek. These are my Bride, and they will follow me wherever I go. Behold! I will make them powerful, and nothing has ever been seen on earth that can compare to the abilities with which I will clothe them. They will be clothed in fine, white, spotless linen, and their abilities will embody their accomplishments, and great abilities will they possess; for they are faithful, called, and chosen, even from before the foundations of the world by Yahweh for these purposes.
My 144,000 will descend on Mount Sion, and I will lead them. They will take those to whom I lead them into the wilderness to be hidden away from the utter darkness and persecution of the enemies’ kingdom. They will be led to safety from the full indignation of the wrath of God contained in seven vials; for in these vials is the severity of the wrath of God to be poured out on the seat of the beast and to torment the kingdom of the Dragon, for great is their punishment. And the 144,000 will lead Jacob to safety; they will heal them from their wounds; they will succor them and give them great hope to call on the name of the Lord, even to the end if need be. For had I not shortened the days, no flesh should be saved. And so they will complete that in which I will lead them. And Jacob will be hidden safely away from the day of that great battle, even that great battle of Armageddon of which their utter destruction they shall not escape.
Wherefore, understand my kinsman the times you live and the deception you face that will overtake the entire earth; of which deception will swallow alive in judgment those who hate and reject Yahweh in consequence and great punishment for their faithless ways.
I am the Lamb of God who was given to take away the sins of the world in righteousness.
I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.

I love you my countrymen, therefore, rest in the works of Yeshua HaMashiach in whom Moses is alive and well that you may rest from your own works and celebrate many Sabbaths and feasts in my holy kingdom, of whose time has come. Truly, truly the times are now!

Along Came a Spider.
NOVEMBER 25, 2024
Hear, hear, my Words O’ Israel and bow your hearts in obedience to the sound of my voice and receive in meekness the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach that by the Words of The Everlasting Gospel you may obtain salvation and come to eternal life in your true Messiah who truly does fight for you in love. So I come to warn you, even those of Jacob and all those who read and accept the words of The Everlasting Gospel in saving faith that they may have faith in Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Jesus the Christ, and that they may have faith in Yahweh the Great I AM of whose heart The Everlasting Gospel remained hidden until the times of its revealing and so John the Revelator did seal up the voices of the seven thunders whose voices he did hear. And so I come to warn you of the spider who has woven its web and has caught the world in its embrace; even as it feeds on the lifeblood of others, and so that you may avoid its many webs so you are not taken in its deadly embrace.
Therefore, bow your hearts in obedience and hear the words of your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach! For truly I do come to make the wise man amongst you wiser still that you may discern the times you live and that you may understand your enemies and their nature and lying ways; because they move in great secrecy and stealth and by deception they do war. Because they are all pretenders who pretend, and the spider moves in great secrecy and stealth until the spider’s prey is caught in its web of which the spider will always use for its nefarious purposes.
Therefore, I do come to warn you of the spider and show you its ways so you may avoid its poison and keep yourselves from its paralyzing and deadly embrace. But what spider has ever made itself an empire and a nation? And what spider has ever joined the confederacy of the fallen ones, even happily doing its part in rebellious evil? And what spider has ever assumed the identities of those caught in its web? Yet so is the spider of which I come to warn you and truly, truly, the spider is one of many components of the enemies kingdom and a venomous and poisonous spider it truly is.
Because the spider does weave its web in stealth and deception. Even a web of deception and a web of debt does the spider weave, and its web now cocoons the entire earth in its stealthy embrace. Consider a spider in its natural setting, it weaves its web stealthily in places where it can catch its prey even as its prey lands unawares in its web. And as its victim fights to free itself from the web in which it was ensnared unawares trapping itself further, the spider springs into action and injects its venom as it cocoons its prey in its web. Then the spider keeps its prey for its own purposes and feeds slowly on its victim until nothing remains, leaving its victim utterly desolate until truly its victim is not.
Yet so are the ways of the natural spider created for Yahweh’s purposes, except which of you has ever seen a spider work in tandem with an empire and nation of other spiders; yet the fallen ones have united their spiders in these end-times. And so I come to warn you of a people descended from Japheth who begat Gomer and from Gomer came Ashkenaz and of Ashkenaz a nation because Ashkenaz is in the table of nations in the orders of old even in the days when men lived under the Noahic covenant, of which covenant mankind forsook and yet there was faithful Abram who sought the ways of Yahweh when the earth rebelled once again against their creator. Yet even though, natural man rejected Yahweh’s covenant; Yahweh is

The BITTER SWEET

faithful to his promises just the same. And not one promise of the covenant Yahweh made with Noah (who was a righteous man in Yahweh’s sight) has ever fallen to the ground unfulfilled and all shall be yea and amen forevermore because Yahweh is always perfectly faithful!
After the earth was flooded in the days of Noah, the earth was divided by lot of inheritance amongst Noah’s sons in the days of Peleg, and so Japheth went into his inheritance in the lands of the north. And the people were of one language, and the sons of Ham congregated in the land that became Babylon. And the princes of Nimrod took counsel together with Phut, Mitzraim, Cush, and Canaan and their families to build their city and in it a strong tower even a high tower so that they could wage war on the heavens and that they would congregate themselves so they could make a name for themselves in rebellion of Yahweh’s command to be fruitful and multiply so they could repopulate the earth. But so are the ways of faithless natural man, who in his lusts and pride serves sin and therefore serves the Father of sin; even the devil, by way of mankind’s disobedience to Yahweh due to the sin in natural man’s flesh.
And from the posterity of Nimrod who grew in wickedness it is said from the wicked goes forth much wickedness. And so Nimrod did pollute the earth in the ways of the fallen ones and from his conjurers and sorcerers came the mystery schools of old where the fallen ones conjurers taught their worthless mysteries to those who will be cast to the flames forevermore in the sins of the Satans, and they will join them in their eternal inheritance. And Nimrod did rise in the first empire after the flood of Noah, even where Nimrod ruled the earth in unrighteousness; even a rule the fallen ones seek to have for themselves fully over the earth, yet no golden age will they have but harsh judgment.
So Yahweh in judgment did cause the earth to open up and swallow a third of their tower, and fire fell from heaven consuming another third of the tower, and a third part was allowed to remain as a memorial against them. Therefore, is the name of it called Babel, because Yahweh did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Yahweh scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. And many nations and peoples did reject and forget Yahweh who entered covenant with Noah, and so they forgot the covenant Noah made with Yahweh according to their inheritance and according to the languages they spoke did they forget Yahweh’s covenant with Noah, and they did turn to the ways of the fallen ones because there is no other choice. (And yet Abram became Abraham and the just shall live by faith!)
At Babylon did Nimrod do much evil even as he made many idols and claimed himself a god and made his blasphemous trinity, even an unholy three, intended to mock the true godhead and the promised seed of the woman and to lead astray the sons of men in unrighteousness. And so did Nimrod establish his socalled mystery schools as the knowledge of the fallen ones once again began to spread and cover the earth and mankind once again changed the truth of Yahweh into a lie and worshiper and served the creation more than the creator who is blessed forevermore, Amen!
And as the people were scattered from Babylon so too was the spurious knowledge and ways of the fallen ones scattered abroad with them, even with all their disgusting and blasphemous rituals of those who eat the flesh with the blood and those who drink the blood of Adam where the life of the flesh does reside; even utterly corrupt and abominable practices that Yahweh has forbidden once, all, and forevermore because Adam was made in the image of Yahweh and the life of the flesh is in the blood. Yet they continue in their disgusting and blasphemous ways to this very day, and their practices and rites have been preserved in those who worship devils and bow to dumb idols and these are the ways of the spider, and yet the spider

pretends to be righteous Jacob of whom he has neither part nor lot.
And so the ways of evil were entrenched into the ways of the peoples of the nations once again. And of Gomer came Ashkenaz and of Ashkenaz in time came a great nation of people who became nomads who lived and roamed the Eurasian step and its vicinity even where they did make their empire. Even of which, their empire grew in unrighteousness and fell to their enemies just the same. Even of whose enemies attacked them on account of their unrighteousness and instead of accepting Jesus the Nazarene and departing from evil they instead pretend to be Jacob, and of Jacob there was never a tribe of Ashkenaz of Japheth. Even so they rejected Jesus the Nazarene because they are of their father the devil and his lusts are they forevermore bound to do.
And of the people of Ashkenaz whose ways were evil and deceptive came a people, except of the race of Adam they were not fully, but evil tares planted amongst Yahweh’s wheat who have corrupted themselves forever in unrighteousness. Even those who were born of their father the devil because the devil’s seed does yet remain, although I will utterly root them out and cast them to the furnace just as Yahweh has declared. And of Ashkenaz came the spider but a natural spider it was not, but a nation of abominable spiders even altered from the image of Yahweh their creator, who and are forevermore bound to the lusts of their Father the devil of whose lusts they will do. And so the spiders were scattered abroad, even as they did flee from the hands of the enemies of unrighteousness who stood against the ways of the spider. And so Ashkenaz rejected Yeshua HaMashiach, of whom they have neither part nor lot.
So in truth mankind has been led astray of the fallen ones since Adam fell from his sinless state of which he was created in the garden of Eden and corruption did spread across the earth through the bloodline of Cain. Of which corruption the fallen watchers did corrupt further when they descended on Mount Hermon in the days of Jared. Therefore, did Yahweh wash their corruption from the face of the earth in that great deluge in the days of Noah and yet the fallen ones did reestablish their ways after the flood for so Yahweh did allow mankind to select for himself. Because truly, truly, Yahweh has given all he created with free will in his creation freedom to choose whether they will live the ways of Yahweh or choose to serve the Satans in their rebellion of which rebellion is soon at its end. Because I, even Yeshua HaMashiach, am he who will bruise the head of the serpent, even he who will utterly destroy his kingdom never to rise again.
So it is and so is the truth that I taught concerning the kingdom of heaven when I came to Israel as the Lamb of God during my time in the flesh in Judea. For so, it is written: The kingdom of heaven is like a man which sowed good seed in his field. But while men slept, there came his enemy, and sowed tares amongst the wheat, and went his way. And when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. Then came the servants of the householder, and said to him, Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then have the tares come? And he said to them, Some envious man has done this. Then the servants said unto him, Will you then that we go and gather them up? But he said, No, unless while you go about to gather the tares, you pluck up also with them the wheat. Let both grow together until the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in sheaves to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
Even so because wheat bows in obedience while tares stand erect in evil defiance. Selah!

Yet so it is that the times of gathering have come, and I will gather my wheat into Yahweh’s barn because the time to harvest the first fruits has come. And so it will come to pass that I will utterly root out the tares and bind them, and they will be cast to the fires in their judgment. So understand the earth you live and even the war into which you were born. Even the seed war that has raged since the garden of Eden where Yahweh did declare war on the serpent and the fallen ones because of their wickedness and for corrupting the garden of Yahweh. Of which war culminates in utter defeat for all who have rebelled in such fashion with the fallen ones and their inheritance of burning brimstone does await.
And so Yahweh did declare: I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed, and you shall bruise his heel and he shall bruise your head. And so was my heel bruised in my crucifixion when I gave myself as the perfect Passover as the Lamb of God willingly into the hands of my cruel enemies. And I am the promised seed of the woman who will utterly crush Satans head and I will make my enemies my footstool, because I am the Lion of the Tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war!
Therefore, understand that the seed war is won fully in Christ Jesus even as I had Peter write these many jubilees ago: Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which lives and abides forever. And again did I have John the Revelator write in his letter: Whosoever is born of God, does not commit sin: for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever does not practice righteousness, is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother. Therefore, all who are sealed in Christ can never be corrupted in such manner and neither can they sin where they are altered from the seal of the living God, even Yahweh to whom they belong. Wherefore, do not allow such foolishness to trouble you that those born again of my holy spirit of sonship and sealed with the seal of Yahweh can ever be plucked from my mighty hand by any means whatsoever. Therefore, for those who have achieved salvation your salvation is secure.
And so the ways of the spider I will reveal, and I will reveal the spider fully, although spiders love to move in great stealth, I will yet expose their ways. Because these mutated spiders are those who assume the identities of those they plan for and do murder. These are spiders who thrive on great cruelty and love to torture their prey for no other reason than to satisfy the lusts of their Father of which they are bound to serve and of whose offspring they are. These mutated spiders of which I speak even the same are robbers, and thieves, and murderers and pretenders (and much, much more are they guilty) who can never have enough and who lust for the death of Adam that they may have their golden age forevermore along with the fallen ones. And so the spiders have moved out across the world and woven their webs together in great stealth and secrecy.
Even a great web of debt because the spider thrives and has made itself rich with gold that it has acquired through unjust usury. The spider has hidden itself amongst and disguised itself as Jacob and a convincing disguise have they made for themselves. Because the spider cannot show itself truly as an evil, mutated spider; for what fowler sets the snare in sight of the bird? But the spider disguises itself and changes its appearance and mannerisms to blend in with those it wishes to feed. And as the spider begins to weave its web amongst those who have unwittingly allowed the spider space to weave amongst their nation; the spider then brings more spiders either who come to join it in his evil conquests or by way of more tares

hatching from the spiders egg sac who scurry off to weave their own webs and continue the cycle of death. And so is Adam bound and cocooned by these evil arachnids. And slowly and with great delight do they ensnare and feed on Adam and with great cruelty and malice does the spider seek the entire earth for itself and their Fathers to whose lusts they are bound.
Because in its deception the spiders of Ashkenaz have joined themselves to Esau, by way of the Talmud because in many jubilees past they did adopt the Talmud as their master and ruler, yet a true proselyte of Moses they are not, nor do they follow the way of Yeshua HaMashiach but they do pretend. And of Esau were my murderers and by the false wisdom of Esau, even their blasphemous traditions of men that they elevate above the ways of Yahweh, have they polluted Jacob and ensnared Esau’s brother many times over. Even so I said to them during my time in the flesh as the Lamb of God: You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do: he has been a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, then he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
Yet the spider has never departed from the ways of the fallen ones and the spider still partakes and relishes its evil practices. Because the spider preys on children it has cocooned as its prey and drinks the blood thereof from the little ones it torments in its embrace. Because the spider fulfills its disgusting lusts on the little ones from whose host nation they kidnap in great stealth as the little ones are taken in its web. And of what spider has there been that both weaves a web and yet tunnels into the earth. Because the spiders web even goes under the earth and its web covers a great expanse and a worldwide empire and kingdom does the spider seek. And so the spider does move in great deception because by deception they do war.
And yet these pretenders who have joined themselves to the fallen ones forevermore and of whose offspring they truly are; do pretend to be Jacob and have falsely laid claim to the land of promise, of which they have neither part nor lot but are pretenders who pretend. And of their ways comes the trap that the beast from the earth will set for Jacob because by way of Esau’s Talmud has Ashkenaz united in confederacy with Esau, and they will be further united by the lamb of the dragon, even their false lamb with two horns. Even an unnatural lamb where one horn rules the sea according to Noahide and the other horn rules the promised land in great blasphemy and deceit because he is Daniel’s little horn, and so will the earth be ruled by their rule for a short time. Because they will unite all forces and factions of evil under their rule, and they will gather them together to battle on that great day, where they will all be violently cast down forevermore and into everlasting punishment and judgment will they forevermore go.
And yet the spiders ways are ways of blackmail, and extortion, and murder, and corruption and many, many evil ways does the spider teach and live because the spider always seeks to make more spiders who are twofold the children of hell as themselves. And so the spiders do dance and celebrate themselves over their genocide on the people of the land, even dancing with arms intertwined while they dance in joy at the death and destruction of their victims many of whom are women and children and babies; and so their destruction lingers not. Yet they have taken the worlds leaders and ensnared the kings of the earth both by consent and by conquest, and they have nearly subjugated the entire earth in their many webs and in their webs is the earth bound and given into the hands of the dragon for judgment and destruction that has nearly fully arrived. And yet the spider cries aloud in pain as he feeds on his prey even so that it may ever appear the poor persecuted victim, when in truth it is the spider who persecutes and victimizes Adam.

Therefore, hearken to my voice my countrymen, even all who read these words and separate your selves from the spider and its webs, because when anyone turns from their destruction to call on the name of the Lord, even Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach who is Israel’s true Messiah; truly, truly that person shall be saved.
Truly, truly, I command you one and all to fully repudiate and reject their blasphemous Talmud that is a book of great evil, filth, and deceit; even a book penned by Esau and adopted by the Synagogue of Satan, of which synagogue only evil and filth resides. Because the spider is the Synagogue of Satan, even born of the tribe of Ashkenaz of Japheth who have neither part nor lot in the inheritance of Shem, and especially that of righteous Jacob of whom I will save alive a mighty remnant.
Wherefore, come out from amongst them and be ye separate and turn to Yeshua HaMashiach that you may learn of me and that you may learn to live the righteous ways of Yahweh of whose ways I am and of whom I am the Word made flesh, because Moses is alive fully in Yeshua HaMashiach and in my New Testament are all the promises and covenants of old, which promises will be fulfilled fully and in full in my millennial reign and Kingdom that I will establish in righteousness on the earth.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach who is the true Messiah of Israel, and truly I am your King, Lord, High priest and Messiah forevermore and of my Kingdom and rule there shall be no end.
I am he who comes to warn my countrymen of this great deception and destruction that surely has engulfed the earth in its web because the spiders have woven their webs worldwide now.
I am Christ Jesus, and I have sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these words been sent.
I am Jesus the Christ, who also is Yeshua HaMashiach who has revealed the Words of The Everlasting Gospel along with Yahweh himself in the times of revealing which are now. Even the times of revealing before Jacob’s trouble begins in full that Jacob may yet be saved.
Therefore, understand the gravity of my Words and be not faithless but only believe my testimony and hear my Words and depart from stubborn unbelief and rebellion because now are the times to return to Yahweh by way of Yeshua HaMashiach even in times of trouble of which times have come.
And all who come to their Everlasting Messiah and accept me and my New Testament will achieve salvation in their own orders. Those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the honors of martyrdom will be resurrected at the resurrection of the just and the weight of their eternal reward will far surpass their struggles and troubles of which I will strengthen them to overcome just as Yahweh strengthened me to overcome.
And those from Jacob whom I will hide away in the wilderness from the times of the greatest tribulation ever; after which they will be taken alive into my millennial Kingdom even that they may be fruitful and multiply, and we will live the ways of Yahweh because in righteousness will the earth be ruled, and no evil thing will enter therein.
And it is I, Yeshua HaMashiach who does declare the fullness of times for the earth to birth those who have fallen asleep in Christ and to deliver those who are alive and remain at my appearing and who are found faithful in Christ, because truly, truly the times are now. Selah!

The Blood of the Lamb of Yahweh.
DECEMBER 03, 2024
Come to your everlasting Lord and hear my Words, my kinsman, and bow your hearts in obedience at the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach. Because I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will make the wise man among you, O’ Israel, yet wiser still when you are obedient to my instructions that you may then receive further wisdom and knowledge because wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times and strength of salvation, the fear of the Lord is your treasure.
Therefore, understand the times you live that you may walk with precision and that my purposes of salvation may come to full completion in you who are called according to my name, even you O’ Israel, although you currently do not know me nor do you live my ways because Israel is ruled by Esau and Ashkenaz, when it is plainly stated the elder shall serve the younger and neither Esau nor Ashkenaz have any claim to Jacob’s birth right of inheritance. And yet, Jacob rejected Yeshua HaMashiach and I did turn to the nations for a season to fulfill what Israel was never obedient to fully fulfill (they did fulfill in part as evidenced by Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.) that from Israel would the nations be blessed and that of the lost tribes a remnant would be saved.
Nevertheless, when you turn your hearts in obedience to the sound of your true Messiah’s Words of instruction you will be restored as a peculiar people to Yahweh, even though your fathers turned from Yahweh long ago. Yes, they turned from Yahweh when they rejected me, Jesus the Nazarene, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, even in the days when Pontius Pilate ruled Judea when I was delivered of their chief priests and Sanhedrin into the hands of sinful men to do those things of which the law explicitly forbade them to do, yet in their hatred for me and for all things of Yahweh they readily did so with great malice and cruelty. And so is the salvation of Adam accomplished by the hands of his enemies, that whoso believes and calls on the name of Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach shall be saved to the uttermost.
And so it is because I am the lamb of Yahweh, how else could atonement for the sins of mankind ever be accomplished except my sinless blood is spilled in sacrifice to pay a sum that truly is priceless. Understand that although natural man does boast in great pride that he is self-made and self-sufficient in all things, natural man is fallen into a sinful and deplorable state of unrighteousness and reproach that is justly deserved.
Yet, in my grace and mercy and sacrifice of myself on Golgotha when I presented myself to Yahweh as the lamb of God when I offered myself in great agony as my last drop of blood flowed onto Golgotha, even to my last breath when I uttered the words it is finished. And I was buried, and rose again the third day according to scripture; even as Yahweh promised he would do, because it is impossible that death could hold the sinless blood. And Yahweh resurrected me where, shortly afterwards I then entered into the holiest of holies in the heavens themselves, where I did present myself as high priest forevermore to Yahweh, the great I AM, of which sacrifice he eternally accepted. Seeing then that you have so great a high priest, which is entered into heaven, even Jesus the son of Yahweh, let us hold fast our profession. For you have not an high priest, O’ Israel, which cannot be touched with the feeling of your infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sin.

So I ask, O’ Israel, what is finished? So I plainly answer: My new covenant, which is an everlasting covenant even my New Testament! For the testament is confirmed when men are dead: for it is yet of no force as long as he that made it, is alive; and almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission of sin. In like manner as the Old Testament when Moses had spoken every precept to the people, according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and purple wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament, which God has appointed unto you.
Yet, the testament of Old, even Moses former testament was never intended for the conclusion of Yahweh’s plan of redemption for mankind, nor was Israel ever supposed to congregate in arrogance, forming fractious sects along many unneeded, and murderous divisions. But instead Israel was meant to stand as a beacon of salvation to the gentiles that the nations would see that there is a God in Israel and so that the nations would pour into Israel to learn of Yahweh according as it was written during times of old.
Therefore, understand the temporal nature of Moses as practiced by Israel in the times before my New Testament and understand that Moses fully lives in your true Messiah, even the holy one of God who perfectly lived according to Moses and who gave his life once, all, and forevermore to pay the penalty of Moses for you. As it is written, therefore, understand my New Testament, O’ Israel: For the Law having the shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which they offer year by year continually, sanctify the comers thereunto. For would they not then have ceased to have been offered, because that the comers, once purged, should have had no more conscience of sins? But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again of sins every year.
For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. And so it is my countrymen, that Moses could only ever temporarily purge sins, and yet many sins under Moses remained where those who committed such things were cut off from the people forevermore on account of their sins. Therefore, Moses was a shadow of things to come, of which things are fulfilled fully in my sacrifice of myself, because my sinless blood atones for all sins, once all and forevermore, even so that all who are of Adam may achieve salvation thereby. Yet for those who accept the mark of the beast, no forgiveness will they ever have.
And so it is written of Yeshua HaMashiach, that by my life and obedience Adam could be restored to Elohim, his eternal and righteous creator. Wherefore, when he comes into the world, he says, sacrifice and offering you would not: but a body have you ordained me. In burnt offerings, and sin offerings, you have had no pleasure. Then I said, Lo, I come (In the beginning of the book it is written of me) that I should do your will, O God. Above, when he said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings, and sin offerings you would not have, neither had pleasure therein (which are offered by the Law) Then said he, Lo, I come to do your will, O God, he takes away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified, even by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once made. And every Priest of Levi stands daily ministering, and oft-times offers one manner of offering, which can never take away sins: But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, sits forever at the right hand of God, And from henceforth tarries, until his enemies be made his footstool. For with one offering has he consecrated forever them that are sanctified thereby.
For Yahweh also bears us record: for after that he had said before, This is the Testament that I will make

unto them after those days, says Elohim, I will put my laws in their heart, and in their minds I will write them. And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these things is, there is no more offering for sin. And you stand in a time of national ignorance where your Fathers long since rejected he who is the perfect Passover Lamb of Yahweh himself, even where Yahweh so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten son that whosoever believes on the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, even Jesus the Christ even that person will be saved to the uttermost. And so I call on you to turn from your ignorance and partial blindness, O’ Israel, even by rejecting and repudiating fully the blasphemous wisdom of Esau contained in his filthy Talmud and return to the pure Words of Yahweh, even of which Words have been preserved within the Byzantine line of Texts, even the Textus Receptus as preserved in the Stephens text.
Therefore, understand what rejecting Yeshua HaMashiach eternally means for you Israel so you may understand the seriousness of said rejection. For if you sin willingly after that you have received and acknowledged that truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a fearful looking for of judgment, and violent fire, which shall devour the adversaries. He that despised Moses Law, died without mercy under two, or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment suppose you shall be worthy, which treads under foot the Son of God, and counts the blood of the New Testament as an unholy thing. Therefore, accept my sacrifice and confess your sins to me so I may forgive you for I am faithful and just to forgive you your sins that you may be purified in my atoning blood and confess your faults one to another.
Therefore, I do come to you in my mercy and grace so that I may lead you away from your partial blindness, O’ Israel, even that you may yet obtain salvation by your obedience to my voice and so that you may depart from the rejection of your Fathers that is enshrined forevermore in your filthy Talmud and in your filthy religion that Esau has made for your destruction, but of which you cling as if his wisdom was given by Yahweh himself, and not Satan. O’ Israel, hear my saving voice and accept my love for you and come to me with your full hearts open and ready to receive that you may yet be filled with all glory and virtue.
I give you to understand the complete forgiveness and restoration my atoning blood does bring to all who accept me as their saving Lord, and also as their true Messiah, for so I am. And as Adam was created, formed, and made sinless and in full perfection up until the day he sinned willfully, so too does payment for Adam’s sin require sinless blood, even an impossible requirement for all those who dwell on the earth in corruption to provide. And in Yahweh’s love he did provide such perfection and sinless blood in the body of his only begotten son who is given in sacrifice for the sins of Adam, therefore there remains no more sacrifice for sin.
I am he who gave himself in full for the sins of fallen Adam
I am he who offered myself fully in everlasting atonement that all who submit themselves to eternal salvation may be purified thereby.
I am he who is your High Priest forevermore after The Order of Melchizedek, even he who offered myself as the perfect Passover once, all, and forever more.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, even he who is your true Messiah and of my rule there is never an end.
I am Christ Jesus, and I have sent my Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have my Words been sent.

Therefore, understand the fulfillment of all things has come, O’ Israel, and I am calling you to myself by way of The Everlasting Gospel that is given in the proper times of revealing and the times of revelation are now. Because from the beginning Yahweh did state to the serpent in the garden during the times where sin entered the world, I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed, you shall bruise his heel, and he shall bruise your head.
And so in the course of time David, when he was a young shepherd boy, who became King of Israel before the kingdom was divided; who also became a man after Yahweh’s own heart, defended Israel and slew that giant Philistine, even Goliath of Gath who was a tare descended from the Rephaim! So David the young shepherd boy went out to war with Goliath of Gath even as a shepherd, with staff, scrip and sling, going to battle against a giant warrior, but David went to war in the name of Yahweh, who the Philistines defied, and David stood to fight against the enemies of Israel so that the host of Elohim could be victorious.
As the stone from David’s sling caused this unholy giant to fall to the ground groveling about, David drew this giants own sword and cut off his head. And as it is written of old: And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent. So David buried the skull of Goliath of Gath outside the city walls of Jerusalem. Yet, in my sacrifice of myself as the lamb of God, I was taken outside the city walls and there at Golgotha was I crucified, even the place of the skull. And as I was crucified they did nail me to that rugged tree where they did bruise my heel with their nails when they nailed me to that rugged stake. And so victory was there obtained for Adam when my heel was bruised there at Calvary where Satan’s head was likewise crushed as my blood flowed, bringing victory over the seed of the serpent forevermore. Therefore, in the same manner as a shepherd boy defeated Satans own seed, so to did the chief Shepherd defeat Satan forevermore in my sacrifice of love that I made for the sins of Adam.
Yet, as I was dying in great agony as a common criminal (of which criminality I remain innocent) outside the city gates of that holy city, my sinless blood did there drain out of my body in full representation of the sinful man of red earth coming to full redemption. And as my blood soaked the red earth at the place of the skull there at calvary was the head of the serpent bruised eternally and forevermore, and in the consummation of all things that old dragon himself will be bound and cast eternally to the fires of punishment where their worm dies not, for so is his inheritance.
And I am he who is coming to utterly destroy the enemies kingdom so that the dragon may be bound and sealed into the abyss for a thousand years that my righteous rule on earth may be established. At the end of which he shall be loosed for his little season where he will gather his final rebellion. And as they attack the camp of the saints fire will descend from Yahweh himself and devour them utterly at which time Satan will be cast to the eternal fires burning forevermore with putrid brimstone.
Wherefore, I give you to understand, O’ Israel, the penalty of Moses is paid fully by the sacrifice of Yeshua HaMashiach who is Jesus the Christ in the English tongue even so that you may understand the completeness of my sacrifice and the perfection accomplished by my ever atoning blood that was spilled and given for the sins of Adam. Understand in full, O’ Israel, that had the fallen ones understood the mystery of Yahweh, they never would have crucified your Lord of Glory! For by my crucifixion where the serpent temporarily bruised my heel, the serpents head is now bruised eternally, even a bruise of which he shall never recover.

The Mirror Lies!
DECEMBER 05, 2024
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me of a world where screens abound captivating all! By repeating lies that are repeatedly told, with lying images nonstop so in great deceit their minds they mold with ritualistic entertainment so that sheep are led astray by concepts their thoughts behold! Even so, they are enthralled by the lusts of the flesh, and the lusts of the eyes and the pride of life which is stoked and inflamed in spurious knowledge given for so-called education wherever their lies are cunningly sold. Thereby, ears are tickled and soothed with repetitive frequencies so that the proud and foolish are manipulated and controlled. And in time they have found that through mind controlling nursery rhymes mankind’s behavior is changed accordingly and in their spell he is bound!
Yet so is the world you live, O’ Israel, even a world that lies completely in wickedness, even a world that is taken captive and enthralled completely by a tapestry of lies that are given to program the masses to their murderous narratives given nonstop now for the destruction of Adam. Mirrors, mirrored everywhere, but in the mirror’s gaze truth is not there, because truth is not seen by eyes beholden thereunto because their mirrors are deceptive to weave a false reality made by the fallen ones technologies designed to enslave mankind to their lies so that Adam forevermore dies.
Black mirrors, mirrored everywhere and placed for display wherever the eyes may roam, so that mirrors tell the same lies synced by malevolent design, so natural man is entertained by sin and death and is enchanted by many and great enchantments that are packaged as wisdom and prosperity but instead cause death and destruction because there is no truth in the lying images they provide. Black mirrors, mirrored and held in hand where image after image builds insanity and strong delusion on the land, where truth is not separated from lies, of which all who have pleasure in unrighteousness shall not escape but shall eternally die in flames of everlasting destruction even a punishment they are eternally bound and there is nowhere they can run nor hide where avoidance of judgment can be found.
O’, hear them sing! Listen and hear a multitude of mockingbirds’ voices sing in unison, in tune with synchronized lying images their black mirrors constantly provide. They sing so close to the songs of true song birds but in truth theirs is a counterfeit song telling lies so that their voices are in sync with false sincerity in their deceptions they thereby seek to hide. And yet these lying mockingbirds have no songs of their own but copy and repeat the songs of true song birds without actually writing or understanding the words in the songs they sing, and so the images broadcast on black mirrors that are screens are synchronized so that lies repeat and the masses are paralyzed thereby. Even false perceptions and a lying reality where the entire earth is taken in the lies of the fallen ones, even a false reality that has come over the earth only to increase as I remove my restrainer when I gather the faithful in Christ to the safety of the heavens so suddenly and unexpectedly now.
Therefore, hear the words of Yeshua HaMashiach and understand the world you live and the deception that has been allowed to grip the earth in its lying embrace. Even a deception given in judgment where the fallen ones are allowed to have their rule, and that because natural man desires to join the Satans in their rebellion for the wages of iniquity, that he may have pleasure in unrighteousness to his own demise, and so

natural man will now be given over into the hands of his enemies, yet even so a multitude will yet be saved even so by the refiners fire. And further and complete separation will occur during Jacob’s trouble, even a separation where a remnant of Israel is freed from the bondage of Esau and liberated into my millennial kingdom that is so soon to be established on the earth!
Yet, natural man prefers the fallen ones false reality where they seek to hide Yahweh (of which concealment is impossible), yet so is the strong delusion they have broadcast over the earth where all who refuse Jesus the Nazarene, even Yeshua HaMashiach, are enslaved thereby. Therefore, hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach, that you may understand the world you live and the strong delusion that has embraced the earth in its grip. Understand, O’ Israel, that I, Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Christ Jesus am he who will remove your partial blindness when you turn your hearts in full obedience to the sound of my voice, spoken on the faithful lips of the faithful who live by faith in the Son of Yahweh, because the just shall live by faith!
What is it that has been? That, that shall be: and what is it that has been done? That which shall be done again: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything, whereof one may say, Behold this, it is new? It has been already in times of old that were before us. There is no memory of this former time, neither shall there be a remembrance of the latter time that shall be, with them that shall come after. Truly, truly, there will come a time where the fallen ones will not be remembered, nor come into mind and their lying mysteries will forever more cease when they are cast to the flames.
Therefore, understand the lies of old given by the fallen ones to mankind in the world that then was before the great flood of Noah, even these same lies are repackaged and used to destroy mankind once again. Wherefore understand, the fallen ones do bring their technologies and manipulations and lying signs and wonders they used to enchant and destroy mankind in the days of Jared. And the earth will return as it was in the days of Noah and so shall Jacob’s trouble be, even a time on earth ruled by Yahweh’s enemies. Even that great dragon of old who is now bound to the earth for judgment, and many abominations will be unleashed in the world of men; even as Yahweh has declared that he will bring giants to fulfill his wrath.
For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water, and in the water, whereby the world that then was, being violently overflowed with water, perished. But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.
Sadly, many, many multitudes on the earth are willingly ignorant that the world that then was Yahweh violently flooded and perished on account of the Nephilim and their many abominations; and on account of the fallen ones pretending they were gods when they corrupted the ways of mankind on the earth with their worthless mysteries taught to mankind for his own destruction. So hear the truth, and understand my Words, and hear the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach that you may understand truth and so that you are not ensnared by their technologies and that you are not altered by the mark of the beast becoming an abomination reserved for the flames of punishment forevermore.
Because their technologies are that which has been done before, and now is, and will fully come yet again for a final time of finality. Certainly, their technologies will be revealed fully as they continue to roll out their final beast system, with all lying signs and wonders given for them that perish. And so the dragon will rise to rule the earth in great deception by way of a lamb with two horns.

And the fallen ones will reveal themselves as benevolent beings from falsely spinning worlds in their lying cosmology of ever falsely spinning worlds used in the days of old. Understand that above the earth are the heavens and the firmament and even the heaven of heavens where Yahweh sits on his throne, and truly, truly Yahweh reigns supreme over all his creation of which he alone in the beginning created after the counsel of his own will and for his own eternal purposes.
Therefore, study to understand your world as it truly is and understand that planets are wandering stars given for signs and season and are not other worlds with other lifeforms, therefore, repudiate the lies of the fallen ones. These so-called aliens are those who rebelled against Yahweh from the beginning and are extraterrestrial in the sense that their origin is in the heavens on the day that they were created in righteous perfection by Yahweh himself. Yet, in their rebellion they fell from their original perfection, and they have altered themselves eternally and forevermore, and they shall not escape. Yet natural man prefers these lies so that he may fulfill the lusts of his putrid flesh in all iniquity and unrighteousness, and all who walk this wide path of destruction will fall to the eternal flames thereby.
And so they will appear, pretending to care for the affairs of mankind and they will reveal themselves fully when the restrainer is removed as my Church is gathered to me in the clouds. They will appear claiming the have come to protect mankind from an invasion and to save mankind from war and they will come with many well packaged and pleasant sounding lies. However, the ten horns have one mind and will give their power and authority to the beast! And the ten horns are they that shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire in their third world war that is about to engulf the earth. And yet they will appear with their technologies in hand, but they only bring false solutions and false ways of lies and deceit that issue in eternal judgment and damnation for all who join their rebellion.
Yet, so will they rise, even the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth, and they will rise as a lamb with two horns who speaks as a dragon, even the Lamb of the Dragon that Esau has selected for himself to rule the earth in unrighteousness. Even a rule where the nations are ruled harshly by Ashkenaz via Noahide by the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth rules the land and the world by Esau’s Talmud in great deceit as he sets his trap for Jacob.
Understand that the beast from the sea has distanced himself from Secret Babylon that he may distance himself from his crimes which are many, and they will smear his name and seem to make accusations against him. But understand that the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth are from the same abominable bloodlines and work hand in hand, even a beastly duo, to serve and satisfy the dragon’s lustful purposes. The beast from the sea will rise in his time and he will rise to become their promised warrior, even their Mahdi for whom they currently wait. And he will conceal his true nature and his past and his crimes, though such efforts are futile because every sin he has ever committed is perfectly recorded in the heavens. Although, he will fool those who follow him by his empty promises.
And as they rise from the ashes of war they will openly align themselves with the dragon and the fallen ones of whose they already are, and they will quickly move to establish themselves in their final empire, of which they have already set the framework in place, even before Secret Babylon is destroyed by way of the mystery of iniquity. Yet, they will seek to build that which has already been as the fallen ones seek to establish their new golden age, even a golden age they will never have but harsh judgment instead.

Nevertheless, they will rise in great power and the one beast will point to the other and they will testify one of the other and the other of the one and many great and blasphemous things will they speak and many lying signs and wonders will they bring.
Nevertheless, so shall they rise according as it is written. And the Lamb with two horns will work hand in hand with the dragon and they will merge into one all things in their new society. They will merge their financial systems, they will merge their governments, they will tie all things of their new society together and intertwine themselves as one in their new order. They will merge their blasphemous mystery religions of old into a new religion that will seem like the religion of their Fathers who worship their black cubes, yet they will merge their religions into another false religion their Fathers knew not but their cubes will remain. (Yet, neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desires of women, nor care for any God: for he shall magnify himself above all).
Understand what they will do, O’ Israel, because they will make war with the saints and they will overcome them, and all who call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene who is also Yeshua HaMashiach to the end shall be saved, for so it is promised and written. They will blame those who call on the name of Jesus for their crimes and Barabbas will betray the saints of Secret Babylon because many of them have unknowingly dedicated their Churches to the beast from the earth, who is yet to come at the time of this writing. And he has made himself their Lord and peddled Bibles in his own name, yet a Christian he readily admits he is not, although, many foolishly believe that he is.
And as the earth spirals out of control and falls off into great war, and pestilence, and famine, and injustice and death they will blame all things of Christ for their problems they, themselves caused and they will claim aliens took the gathered faithful in Christ, when in truth I will have gathered them to the throne room of Yahweh for the marriage of the bridegroom to his bride and that they may receive their inheritance and be glorified forevermore. Yet on the earth many lies they will tell and they will fabricate many, many things on their black mirrors using the fallen ones manipulations and technologies and many lying signs and wonders will they broadcast on their screens that the masses will readily believe.
Understand that those who live in their cities and those who take the mark of the beast will forever more be altered and they will mingle iron and clay but they shall not cleave one to another. Those who take their mark will be changed and will be slave to their hive mind and the internet of things to be and will be in bondage to do the will of the dragon, of which they will have eternally bound themselves because they will have changed themselves from the image of Yahweh of which they were created. And all who do such things never have forgiveness, because that which is crooked cannot be made straight.
So understand that their new society will be fully based on deception and lies and the inhabitants of the earth will become completely separated in delusion from the true earth and reality of which they will live and reside. The entire earth will be bound in great deception and the masses will wonder after the beast saying, who is like the beast and who is able to make war with them? And many, many people will fall to the flames by falling for their lies and even these same people whose names were never written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will fall eternally because they will have completely rejected Yahweh by rejecting Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach.
This rejection will be final and no forgiveness will they have because they counted the Words of salvation that would have saved them to the uttermost as an unholy thing and concluded the truth of God to be a lie,

even a sin that they will not recover. But so will be the final separation of the times that no evil thing may enter my millennial Kingdom but only those who come to Yeshua HaMashiach who is Jesus the Christ in repentance during the times of salvation because no man can come to Yahweh by any other name nor is there any other way, because I am the true and living way.
These are the times you live, O’ Israel, and you cannot reside in their cities and you cannot join their society because to join them requires the mark and all who take the mark of the beast never have forgiveness. Nevertheless, mankind has been indoctrinated through his ever prized spurious education, even an indoctrination sold as education and the masses are conditioned thereby, and they will accept their lies and the vast majority of natural man will join themselves to the fallen ones forevermore.
Yet so it will be, that all who willingly believe a lie and have pleasure in unrighteousness may be bound to everlasting punishment forevermore for joining the fallen ones, and all who join the fallen ones will share fully in their inheritance that is given without mercy because they have shown no mercy but only cruel hatred to all things of Yahweh.
I am Christ Jesus who is also Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach and I do come as the lion of the tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.
I am he who will destroy the great delusion and false reality of the fallen ones, and into the glorious liberty of truth and righteousness will the creation be delivered into the glorious liberty of the sons of Yahweh.
I am he who is calling those of Israel, and truly all of Adam to salvation that they might be reconciled fully to Yahweh by way of the blood of the lamb, for so I am.
I am Christ Jesus your ascended and resurrected Lord and I have been made a life giving spirit that all who come to me with open heart and open face may come fully to salvation in their everlasting Lord!
I am Yeshua HaMashiach who along with Yahweh the Great I AM have sent the Words of The Everlasting Gospel by my mighty messenger and servant who has overcome all things by coming fully to his Everlasting Lord and Savior in humility and sorrowful repentance and by my mighty messenger and servant have the Words of The Everlasting Gospel been sent for the obedience of all those these Words are hereby sent.
Therefore, understand the treacherous times you live where the entire earth will be carried away in insanity and delusion and evil will be completely unrestrained and yet a great, great multitude will achieve eternal salvation by calling on the name of their Lord Jesus to the end. And in like manner I, Yeshua HaMashiach who is Jacob’s true Messiah, will save alive a mighty remnant of Israel who will be taken and given entry into my millennial Kingdom where every promise will be yea and amen!
Wherefore, O’ Israel, repudiate their technologies and do not become further enchanted by their black mirrors, even their screens where people are currently enslaved as they spend their lives in futility going from screen to screen as they are captivated and entertained by sin. Even a fake reality that seems real but in truth, is a false narrative and nothing more than cleverly interwoven fables intended for mankind’s destruction.

Judgment Begins at the House of God!
DECEMBER 10, 2024
Hear the words of Yeshua HaMashiach my countrymen so that you may understand my ways and that you may come to your true Messiah because I am calling you, O’ Israel, will you yet hear my voice? Therefore, bow your ears in obedience and circumcise your hearts, that the wise man amongst you may yet become wiser still should they become obedient to my teaching and meek to my instructions. Because I do come to tell you of those who will take the mark of the beast, even so that you may understand their beginning from their end, and so that you are not ensnared and taken away thereby.
Therefore, understand the times you live and understand the final separation that is about to commence so soon as my faithful in Christ are gathered to me in the clouds so suddenly and unexpectedly now. So it is and so it will be that I will suddenly and unexpectedly descend from the heavens to the clouds to gather the faithful in Christ when the trumpet of God sounds with a mighty shout with the voice of the archangel. Then the dead in Christ will rise first and those who are alive and remain will be gathered in the clouds to meet their everlasting Lord in the air and so they will be taken into the safety of the heavens and so will they ever be with and forever changed to be fashioned like their everlasting Lord of righteousness!
Yet, my appearing will not be done in secret as false study Bibles erroneously teach, nor will there be some false dispensation to descend on the earth separating Israel from my true Church, because the faithful in Christ Jesus are the Israel of God and will take their places amongst the orders and tribes in the heavens and are one new man. So it is written in Paul’s letter to Galatia: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace shall be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Therefore, understand that I am he who will cause Israel to no more be a divided kingdom for evermore and for all eternity. Therefore, reject the lies of dispensationalist, Zionist wizards and accept the truth of Yeshua HaMashiach!
So I give you to understand that dispensations and secret raptures are concepts that are fabricated by the Satans whereby they do seek to ensnare the simple and take the meek and lowly in heart by craft with cleverly devised fables and false stories. Yet, my appearing will happen exactly as written and will be seen by all and the world will know that Christ Jesus has appeared as promised for his faithful saints, even leaving the luke warm for the destruction of their sinful flesh that has captured them in sin and so will it be done.
Yet, the faithful in Christ will be gathered as written in scripture to their everlasting Lord! And I will not in any manner be denied my purchased possession, and I will forcefully snatch away all those who are faithfully mine, whether they sleep in the heart of the earth or whether they are amongst the living on the face of the earth: They will be gathered to me in the air just the same. Yet, the fallen ones will lie with their fake alien invasion where they will say that aliens took those gathered in Christ and great war will break across the earth, and the fallen ones will lie many times over, only believe not a word they say. Because the gathering of the faithful in Christ is given as hope and surety that my second coming is near to come at the end of Daniel’s seventieth week, that is a week of seven years where each day of the week reckons as a year.

Yet, the luke warm will remain luke warm no longer because the times of final separation will be fully unrestrained when my restrainer is removed and the ice shall fall. And in like manner will the luke warm come to their decisions, where some will grow red-hot in their commitment and convictions to their Lord Jesus Christ, and some will turn cold as the ice that is about to collapse into the sea, choosing their own eternal destruction instead.
Nevertheless, I, Christ Jesus, will kindle an unconquerable resolve in all those who chose eternal life in Jesus the Nazarene and I will have inspired an unbreakable resolve in them to call on their Lord Jesus to the end, and so they will come to their eternal reward of which sufferings are not worthy to be compared to the eternal weight and glory of the many eternal rewards given to those who overcome; and I will cause those who are my overcomers to overcome in like manner as their Lord, even when I overcame the fallen ones in similar fashion during my sacrifice as the Lamb of God.
And so it will be, that many who could have committed their hearts to their Lord Jesus Christ to the end will instead turn ice-cold to their everlasting Lord and will regrettably forevermore turn away from eternal life to the everlasting fires of punishment because they will have rejected Jesus the Nazarene fully for the pleasures of sin and will choose their own eternal torment when they could have chosen eternal joy in the presence of Yahweh forevermore. And so many who will have once had the eternal choice of becoming Sons of God for all eternity will instead turn away to join the walking damned who will fall eternally to the second death.
Nevertheless, all are free to choose, therefore some will choose wisely and many will choose foolishly. So enter in at the strait gate: for it is the wide gate, and broad way that leads to destruction: and many there be which go in there at. Because the gate is strait, and the way narrow that leads to life, and few there are who find the way that leads eternally to lives of unending righteousness and there is no other choice to be had. Therefore, choose life that both you and your seed may live!
Yet, I do come to warn you, O’ Israel, even so that all may hear my instructions and heed my warnings even all who are near and also all who are far off and scattered abroad because the same choice of final separation remains for all those of Adam who dwell on the earth no matter the nation, or kindred, or tongue from which they are born. And so it will be that as my faithful in Christ are taken from the earth into the heavens to be hidden away from the wrath to come and to be fully rewarded for finishing their courses in faithful obedience to Christ Jesus their resurrected and ascended Lord; that the world will be brought to its knees in faithless unbelief at my appearing and the sudden destruction that follows.
Even so, because I will unexpectedly show my glory in my sudden appearing in the clouds and my brightness will illuminate the skies and all will see the glory of the Lord fill the horizons in glorious brightness and many will be taken suddenly, and the earth will reel and shake and tremble and quake at the presence of Christ Jesus, from whose brightness many will seek to hide their faces. For as the lightning comes out of the east, and is seen into the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
And a great multitude, even the faithful in Christ, will disappear suddenly and unexpectedly without a trace from the earth, because their lives on earth in corrupted flesh are at an end and their courses they will have finished. Therefore, they will be taken into the glory of the heavens, where they will be glorified eternally and rewarded forevermore. Behold! They will be made like their everlasting Lord of Righteousness, and they will be clothed in fine white spotless linen that can never be stained nor corrupted.

They will be given much reward for their faithfulness and righteous works they have performed in my name, even works I gave them to accomplish for their own salvation, benefit, and honor.
And many will carry off rewards of such that have not entered fully into the hearts of men at this time. Although, some will suffer loss when their works are burned by the refiners fire so that all chaff is removed from their lives in eternal purity and so that the stain of evil works may be gone from them forevermore. Understand, that none of you have walked perfectly before me, therefore, some will suffer loss, some will suffer loss and receive reward, and some will receive reward who are my overcomers who will have overcome in like manner as I overcame the fallen ones and I am sat down at the right hand of Yahweh himself, even the great and everlasting I AM. Yet, all who are taken and gathered will have eternal life forevermore and eternal righteous lives will they forevermore live for so are they ordained.
Likewise, as the faithful are taken, so too shall those left behind understand the gravity of their situation and a great multitude will accept reality and the trials that they must endure, and many will weep and howl in repentance and many will live penitent lives of love and sacrifice, and many will lose their lives in love and service to their neighbors who will be in dire circumstances as well and a great multitude will come to me by calling on the name of Jesus the Christ who is their eternal Lord to the end!
And the earth will reel and shake, and great destruction will break across the earth, as sudden war and pestilence, and injustice, and famine and death will cause great destruction on the earth and the earth will be altered from its current configuration by many great earthquakes and many shall perish suddenly and without remedy. And yet many more will remain alive and will survive the coming calamities and many will be left to the trials of Jacob’s trouble that has come upon the earth to test those who dwell on the earth, even to save all those who will yet come to salvation in Yeshua HaMashiach.
Therefore, understand there are several harvests for Adam. The first-fruits barley harvest is for my faithful in Christ, even all those who walked faithfully by my spirit in my times of grace and mercy even those who have cultivated fruit of the spirit in their lives by obedience to my Words as they walked in my spirit of sonship whereby they are sealed to the great day of redemption. These are the faithful in Christ and also my overcomers and my bride and my 144,000 that I will send to save alive Jacob from the hand of Ashkenaz and Esau.
Then will commence the harvest of wheat where the wheat is ripened in the fields and bows in obedience from the weight of the fruit produced, and the tares being fruitless will stand upright in defiance and great threshing will occur, and my wheat will be gathered into life eternal and the tares will be bundled, and bound, and burned in the eternal fires of punishment. So understand that all who refuse to be harvested in obedience at my threshing will join these evil tares in the fallen one’s inheritance of eternal flames that are made specifically for the disobedient and rebellious, and they shall not escape. And so will the unbelievers and faithless go who have rejected Yahweh’s peace treaty, even Jesus the Nazarene who otherwise would have saved them to the uttermost.
So will the end of Satans kingdom be, my countrymen, even a time of separations and harvests that preserves the righteous for all eternity and delivers the unrighteous for everlasting punishment in the inheritance of the fallen ones, even a fate that is reserved for all who continue in disobedience and who continue in the rebellion of the Satans, and the Watchers, and all who follow their evil ways. These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings: and

they that are on his side, called, and chosen, and faithful.
Therefore, understand that from the ashes of war will they rise, even the beast from the sea, the beast from the earth, and the dragon! They will rise from the ashes of great destruction that they themselves caused. Yet, they will blame their destruction that they have caused on enemy aliens, and Christians, and all things pertaining to Jesus the Nazarene, and so Christ will be made an outlaw in their Satanic kingdom. Truly, truly, I, Christ Jesus have neither part nor lot with them just the same, yet all who call on the name of their Lord Jesus to the end shall be saved.
So they will make war on the saints and will overcome them with great cruelty that will be returned to them without mercy for all eternity. Even so, a great multitude of multitudes shall be saved from eternal destruction by the destruction of their sinful flesh that held them in bondage to sin. And so I will remove all pleasures from the earth and I will break the enchantments and sorceries the evil one has inflicted on them that they may yet awake from their slumber to live righteously before me as they come out of sin in full repentance and repudiation of Satans kingdom, that previously they supported by consent in disobedience.
Yet, so will the fallen ones reveal themselves as they pretend to be aliens from other falsely rotating worlds that do not exist in the same manner as their Jesuit indoctrinators have indoctrinated the masses through learning against learning. Even so that the lies of the fallen ones may be believed in great deception by those who have pleasure in unrighteousness. And so is the stage set for these deceivers to reveal themselves because they are all pretenders who pretend.
They will pretend to be benevolent helpers who have come to save Adam from his own destruction, of whose destruction in truth, they will have revealed themselves to facilitate in great stealth and with all deception and with many lying signs and wonders. Because they will bring their technologies and manipulations and abominations and the abyss will be fully opened. Evil will no longer be restrained and all manner of evil will dominate the earth during Jacob’s trouble. Even because natural man desires evil and darkness so much, that Yahweh will now give natural man fully over to the Satans kingdom even so that many may yet be saved, even so as by fire. And this because mankind is evil and his deeds are evil of which evil mankind loves in his rebellion with the Satans. Therefore, mankind will be given over to the Satans fully who already plan Adam’s eternal end, although their plans will come to nothing and only severe and harsh judgment will they have for so are they worthy.
So they will appear with their solutions and technologies in hand and they will appear pretending to be aliens from other pretend worlds that do not exist. And Barabbas will rise, even the beast from the earth and he does rise with the serpents bite in hand. And he will make all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding, count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty six.
Therefore, understand what is written and what the Spirit of Yahweh expressly declares in these end times my countrymen so you may understand the danger of the times you live: If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, yea, of the pure wine, which is poured into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented

in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels, and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment shall ascend evermore: and they shall have no rest day nor night, which worship the beast and his name.
However, they will rise just the same, even the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth, and the dragon and they will rise in their unholy rule and they will dominate the earth in unrighteousness and evil and nothing will be restrained from their evil hearts desire. And so they will promise many great and mighty things. And they will shroud and decorate the serpents bite in great deceit and with many lies and lying promises will they tell surrounding this venom of which no one can escape once they partake.. Therefore, all who take the mark of the beast will have forevermore altered themselves, even an alteration they can not escape since that which is crooked cannot be made straight.
And so they will promise eternal life, and they will promise perfect health and freedom from disease and they will promise perfect harmony with their technologies they will claim are intended for peace, and health and healing. And all who partake of the serpents bite will be forevermore altered from the image of Yahweh in which they were created, thereby making themselves the walking damned who will be slaves forevermore to the lusts of the dragon. Because in truth the mark of the beast is given for Adam’s destruction that the fallen ones may have their golden age on the earth alone with themselves and their abominations and without Adam whom they hate. Even designs that are impossible to realize because no golden age will they have but harsh and severe judgment instead.
Truly, truly, by accepting the serpents bite they will have surrendered their free will in submission to the dragon because they will mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not join one with another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay. Yet they will alter themselves just the same by the serpents bite and by the technologies contained therein. And they will find themselves attached to the internet of things to be, even wherewith they will control and manipulate their slaves to obediently do the will of the dragon as they move in one zombie hive mind of which they can never escape and of which all who are ensnared thereby will be controlled by their frequencies and images in full.
Yet, the dragon knows he has but a short time and truly, a short and shortened time only does the dragon have. Those who accept the serpent’s bite, even the mark of the beast will quickly find themselves betrayed and will very quickly understand that they have been betrayed with many false promises, yet they will be slave to carry out the lusts of the dragon and much evil will they commit as they are controlled and commanded by their technologies of which escape will be impossible.
And so will the lives be of those who reject Jesus the Christ in such manner because to join their society will require taking their beastly mark and all who do have never forgiveness and they shall not escape. Because the times for the righteous to be fully separated from the unrighteous has come, of which unrighteousness the righteous eschew. And it is time for the faithless, and unbelieving to fully join the ranks of the rebellious because all who reject Yeshua HaMashiach have no other choice because all who reject and refuse to choose, even the same by their rebellious disobedience and refusal will have by default chosen that lake of fire burning forevermore with rolling brimstone.
So it will be that those who have taken the serpents bite and given themselves over to genetic alteration will be fully part of their internet of things to be and they will have given themselves into the hands of those who seek their full destruction, even those who consider Adam a hackable animal. Yet, their new society will be one of strong delusion and lies where truth is not to be found. So understand there is no

saving those who take the mark of their own destruction, even the mark of the beast because all who do will be altered and will be used in their mesh technologies and they will serve the purposes of the dragon and evil will be fully unrestrained in their hearts and they will have no conscience neither knowledge nor understanding of Yahweh, in whose image they were once created and from whose image they will be forever altered forevermore.
Therefore, understand O’ Israel that you are now warned fully of the fate of all those who reject Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also Jesus the Christ, who is also Jesus the Nazarene, who is also Christ Jesus! And all who make such a rejection will be subject to the second death and will be harvested as grapes in the winepress of the wrath of God that will kill from the earth all who partake in their society and will be given fully to the harvest of the damned in the second death where their worm dies not and of which they will never escape. And so will they be preserved in torment at the end of their natural lives, even reserved in death for everlasting punishment at that great white throne judgment, where all whose names are not found written in the Lamb’s book of life will be cast to the lake of fire, which is the second death and they will never escape.
So understand Israel, that you will have to live separate from their society and they will seek, and hunt all who refuse their abominable society and all who refuse their beastly mark and all who turn to Yeshua HaMashiach or who call on the name of the Lord Jesus to the end. Even all of these will be fugitives in the earth, and I will hide away in the wilderness by the hands of my 144,000 all those of Jacob, which is Israel, who will have accepted me as their true Messiah.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, even Israel’s true Messiah who has come to save a remnant of Israel alive through Daniel’s seventieth week into my millennial Kingdom that is so soon to be established on the earth. Even all those who accept me as their Messiah and who join themselves forevermore to my New Testament.
I am Jesus the Christ, even he that is sent to the nations to gather the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and even all whosoever decides to accept eternal salvation by making me Lord and calling on my name to their end.
I am Jesus the Nazarene, even he who gave himself as the lamb of God in sacrifice for the sins of mankind.
I am Christ Jesus, even your resurrected and ascended Lord who does come as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah in righteousness to judge and make war.
And so I counsel you O’ Israel, whom I love and of whom I am calling in this very hour that you may come to everlasting salvation by way of Yeshua HaMashiach, who truly truly, is the only way for anyone to come to Yahweh, the great I AM, therefore respond in obedience to my instructions and teaching that you may inherit all things from my merciful hands.
Therefore, come to me in obedience and submit yourselves in love to the voice of your true Messiah, even Yeshua HaMashiach that you may understand your times and that you may have the wisdom and knowledge to navigate and survive the very times that are designed to cleanse evil from the earth and purge the righteous of dead works by fire. Truly, truly, Israel I am he who is given for your eternal salvation even a priceless price that I paid in my sinless and ever atoning blood.

To the Faithful in Christ: Marvel Not!
DECEMBER 15, 2024
Marvel not, my brethren, marvel not, though this world hates you. Know that the world hated me before it ever hated you, my loves, and the servant is not greater than his master. Therefore, understand the times you live and draw ever closer in your hearts to Yeshua HaMashiach, because I am calling you ever closer to me my church, my body, and even my bride, and I am calling you closer still in these times right before you are taken into the heavens that you may fully overcome all things in Christ.
And so suddenly and unexpectedly now will you be taken into the heavens, because I come at an hour you do not expect. Behold! I come as a thief in the night! But as the days of Noah were, so likewise shall the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days before the flood, they did eat and drink, marry, and give in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the Ark, and they knew nothing, till the flood came, and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
So I have counseled you my loves, to depart from the cares of this world, knowing that your departure from this evil world is at hand. Yet, so it is that you still have lives to live, and you must continue until you are not, because when you are taken into the heavens unexpectedly by my mighty hand of salvation your courses will indeed be finished and your lives on earth completed at this time. So I counsel you my little ones, live your lives in complete obedience to the voice of your Lord and Savior, even Christ Jesus your ascended Lord, and I will cause you to fully overcome!
Therefore, as you live your lives give your all to me in your heart’s commitment and motivation because I am your sufficiency in all things. Think not to say in your hearts that you are successful and prosperous by the power of your own hands, neither by institutional degree that many of you so foolishly treasure above the knowledge of Yahweh, even lies sold to you for truth in your spurious educations that are wholly built on lies, yet you foolishly boast of your supposed capabilities gained thereby. And so I tell you yet again, to come out from among them and be separate in all things, or you will share in their judgments and plagues when such a thing is not necessary even because all along the times of now I am calling and begging you to come fully to me in my love for you my children. So depart from the worthless pride that knowledge brings!
Wherefore, I give you to understand anything you have gained in this life concerning this world’s goods is given by the good pleasure and good will and grace of Yahweh, The Great I AM, who wishes above all that you may prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers. Yet, do not be so foolish to think you are self-made or that in your worldly accolades you stand approved before Yahweh, The Great I AM nor Jesus the Christ, because no flesh is justified in our sight. So understand those who elevate themselves in such manner will suffer great loss on account of their pride, that surely goes before great destruction.
For your own sakes, I beg you to come out of this world and all its ungodly attitudes of self-righteousness, self-made, ungodly false justifications and boasting of the flesh. Because, truly, truly, had the grace of Yahweh, The Great I AM, not been poured out in his eternal love for you, even where his eternal love and light has shined in your hearts and lives in the face of Jesus Christ: all of you would be as Sodom and Gomorrah and neither root nor branch would you have, therefore let your boasting be in Christ. However,

So it is, and so will it be, that for my overcomers there is much reward, even for those who have overcome in like manner as I have, and their reward will be the greatest. Yet, so many of my faithful in Christ are tempted and lulled, as it were back to the dead! Even in the face of my commandments I gave to Paul many Jubilees ago in his letter to the Ephesians, and so he wrote, and so I remind you my loves: Wherefore he says, awake you that sleeps, and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give you light. Take heed therefore that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the season: for the days are evil. Wherefore, do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Do you understand the will of your Lord, my little ones? Is it your full focus? Or do you serve yourselves in your heart’s allegiance, seeking more wealth to add to your coffers each day? Have you aligned your hearts in service to corporations, or companies of sinful men for the sake of filthy lucre, even at a time when the very money men hoard and treasure sinfully to themselves will soon be declared worthless before their very eyes? Or have you continued in obedience to my voice and carefully considered each Word I give you for you own salvation? Should you continue in obedience to my voice I will cause you to overcome all things, therefore, faint not!
I implore you still, all those faithful in Christ and all those who will yet become faithful in Christ to continue to turn to me because I am inviting you ever closer and closer to me that the full intimacy of my love for you may strengthen and sustain you in all things, therefore, fear not, neither waste time in self condemnation. Therefore, continue ever fervent in your love and hearts commitment to your Lord Jesus the Christ, my little ones, because there is no more time to waste! And when the trumpet sounds you will either be amongst the foolish virgins who are left to the refiners fire, or you will be found amongst the wise virgins who will be taken into the heavens with their bridegroom any second now. Which will you be and where will you stand when I appear suddenly any second now?
Will you yet allow me to provide oil for your lamps that you might stand at my judgement seat? Will you yet trim your wicks properly by being obedient to my instructions? Or will you choose foolishly to remain your own sufficiency standing in your own self-accomplished righteousness and remain standing amongst the foolish virgins? Even when I have arranged better for you, should you be fully obedient to my voice. So, I counsel you my faithful, continue to come to me in all love and obedience so that I may highly exalt you into the highest of the heavens that you may shine as bright as the stars of the firmament for those things you have obediently done in service to your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness!
So, I ask all of you who know my voice, even you who are called by name, and who call on my name: Are you fully awake? Are your eyes fully opened to the world as it is today? Understand the world you now live is not the same as it was even six months ago, and the earth continues to drastically change right in front of your eyes, although many of you still rationalize away signs and wonders in faithless unbelief seeking instead to go back to sleep. Therefore, check yourselves and plans with your eternal Lord that I may direct your steps and keep you from harm in my love and grace.

So it is, the dragon’s lies now saturate the earth even more than they already did before the dragon was cast down; because the dragon is cast down, is cast down to the earth and is bound under the firmament for judgment, and he knows he has but a short time and his wrath is great! And he does come to make war and his wars will be great, yet no greatness will that old serpent ever have but ever burning and rolling brimstone that burns the hottest flames of punishment.
And so I come to you my loves to encourage you to continue to draw ever closer to my heart by your obedience to my Words, and on the walls of my heart each of your full names are engraven in my love for you therein, that is everlasting and eternal. Yes, in my love for you, (I know each of you better than you know yourselves) I hold you so near to my heart at all times and especially in your times of distresses and trials that you surely face. (I have gathered every one of your tears in my bottle of tears that I may recompense you for each one) And in the battles that rage in this ongoing seed war, that is won in Christ and that rages against the fallen ones; understand, that your battles are won fully in your everlasting Lord! Therefore, rest in your eternal Lord, even Christ Jesus and cease from your own works of futility and rest fully therein, and complete the works of righteousness I have given you to do so that you may prevail over your enemies and I will give you Sabbath! Selah!
Therefore, understand the days you live because none of you have ever lived these days that have come upon the earth in this last time, although they deceptively appear similar to what you have known. Because the earth is in transition and truly the earth is being changed, and truly, truly the earth will continue to forcefully change according to Yahweh’s purposes and designs.
Understand that a time of great transition has come upon the earth, even a time when the earth is being realigned and rearranged by the events and calamities and judgments to come into a restoration of the earth that once was in the days of Noah! And events and judgments will happen just as foretold by the prophets of old that are to occur fully during Jacob’s trouble. Wherefore understand, that many judgments have already begun to fall even in this time of transition because it would be logistically impossible for things to happen any other way.
And so it is written, and so shall it be done, when I gather the faithful in Christ so soon and unexpectedly now when the restrainer will be removed, and the ice will fall, and the seals will be opened, and the trumpets will sound! That my two witnesses will rise who will command fire to fall from the heavens, who will smite the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they like, and who shall cause it to not rain upon the earth during the days of their prophecy at their command, and still many will refuse to repent! Understand that they will stand against the dragon, and the beast and the false prophet and if any mans will is to hurt them then that man must be hurt in like manner. If any man’s will is to kill them that that man must be killed in like manner. These are my two two candle sticks and my two olive trees and many, many things will they reveal during the times of their revealing and their testimonies will be eternally recorded forevermore.
These are the times you live, my little ones, and these are the times you must continue to endure by drawing ever closer into my will for your lives because therein is your safety and salvation. Understand, that you grew up as calves of the stall in my times of grace and mercy that was given for the salvation of the lost tribes who were dispersed amongst the nations and thereby, were the nations blessed and showered in love, compassion, and grace and many achieved salvation thereby. But now the times have greatly changed, and

I do command you to walk with GREAT wisdom, and that you may be wise as serpents and harmless as doves because these times are deceptively dangerous.
Because the dragon is now bound to the earth and the fallen ones grow stronger by the second, yet they are utterly powerless to stand against my mighty voice and utter strength and might! Therefore, I do rebuke and restrain them for your sakes more than you can possibly understand at this time and I have placed all things of the enemies kingdom under your feet that you may indeed trample them if need be. Therefore, fear them not because I have overcome all things, even the full kingdom of Satan; and so too will you overcome in like fashion, if you remain faithful to my Words of instruction I have given and do give for your obedience.
Marvel not, my loves, even as the fallen ones reveal themselves to the earth, marvel not in the least! Because the days of Noah have come! Even days where the Satans and their angels are cast to the earth, never more to return to the heavens from where they are now eternally expelled in utter defeat. Even days when the watchers are now released from their prisons wherein they were bound and kept separate one from another in great torment for their abominable crimes they committed against Yahweh and his creation in the days of old and in utter defeat were they bound from their rebellion and oaths they swore themselves to fulfill. Yet, their oaths will be fulfilled forevermore when they are bound and cast to the fires of punishement in that great lake of burning brimstone where their worm dies not.
Even days, once again, that are returning as in the days of Noah when the watchers descended on Mount Hermon in the days of Jared. Even days that have returned where the fallen ones now directly work hand in hand with the kings of the earth and their worldly governors they hide behind who are complicit in their designs who intend to bring great destruction and calamity and war just so soon as the restrainer is removed, when their evil will be unrestrained fully. Yes, they are loosed on the earth, and when the restrainer is removed Satans full kingdom will be unleashed when the ice falls, and the abyss is opened, and their portals will come alive once more. Behold! I bring giants to fulfill my wrath!
Marvel not, my loves, even as the fallen ones light up the skies under the firmament with their lights, and orbs, as they are now showing themselves in their forms they assume and their machines are now free to fly and much deception and confusion have they risen to cause on the face of the earth with their technologies, even during the conclusion of the birth pangs, that are so suddenly and unexpectedly to be concluded in calamity so shortly now. And so natural man wonders and speculates and rationalizes away the supernatural that has now become natural once again.
Yes, mankind faithlessly reasons away the power of Yahweh shown with the intent that mankind would awake to righteousness and attain salvation. Instead of giving Yahweh credit for his handiwork and signs intended to warn them of impending judgment mankind instead credits mankind and his worthless technologies he gained from the fallen ones: therefore harsh and severe judgment comes! Have neither part nor lot with their faithless reasonings and continue to glorify Yahweh for his works of salvation given in his eternal plans for the salvation of Adam in the face of Jesus Christ, who is the last Adam.
So I give you to understand: no matter whatever entity causes changes in heaven or on the earth, or changes in the earth’s atmosphere, or anyone whosoever who alters Yahweh’s creation in any manner whatsoever: I do command you to fully realize that Yahweh is utterly sovereign over his creation and anything that happens whatsoever only happens with Yahweh’s permission, and with his full knowledge,

and also to fulfill his everlasting plans of salvation for his prodigal son Adam. Understand, that Yahweh allows the unrighteous, hardhearted, and disobedient to live out their sinful lives so that they may fill up their sins to the fullest and their impending judgment they shall not escape, unless they come to Jesus the Christ in full repentance while there is still time.
Even so, Yahweh allows the unrighteous to sin so that in judgment they may be recompensed to the fullest receiving in full recompense their very own evil deeds right back on their own heads for all eternity and forevermore in the flames of punishment, even when such a thing is not necessary and could be avoided in salvation by obedience to righteousness. In Yahweh’s grace, and mercy in his eternal plan of salvation for Adam Yahweh does desire that no man be lost to the flames, nevertheless, all men have been given free will to chose evil, or to choose righteousness in the face of Jesus Christ who will recreate all who come to salvation as one new man, and eternally will they live forevermore.
And so the fallen ones will be released fully in judgment on the inhabitants of the earth who are disobedient by refusing the name of Yeshua HaMashiach who is Jesus the Christ! Therefore, understand that all who refuse Jesus the Christ as Lord, or who live unfaithfully in disobedience from my commandments will be left under their brutal subjugation and rule wherewith they do intend to brutally and completely erase Adam from the face of the earth; in their long devised plans wherewith they intend to steal the earth from my mighty hands, even designs that are impossible for them to achieve in their rebellious madness.
Yet, mankind continuosly walks purposefully directly into their trap, even as he explains away the signs given for his own impending judgment that he still refuses to believe is coming in his faithless reasonings provided by his spurious education wherewith his mind is completely blinded to the true earth he lives, even which earth was created by Yahweh The Great I AM, whose existence mankind seeks to deny in his Jesuit devised spurious education of learning against learning. If when I tell you earthly things and you believe not, how should you believe, if I shall tell you of heavenly things? For no man ascends up to heaven, but he that has descended from heaven, even that Son of man which is in heaven. Will you humble your hearts and believe the Words of the Son of man? Or will you cling to the idols of your heart and the lies of educated fools who speak in direct opposition to the Words given by Yahweh in the face of Jesus Christ?
In mankind’s faithless reasonings he foolishly seeks to provide lying answers to the fallen ones lying signs and wonders. Even answers given by the fallen ones themselves at times to all who refuse the Words of Adonai Yahweh, of which Words are given for obedience by the hand of the true and living way, of which way I, Christ Jesus surely am. Therefore, do not join them in their faithless reasonings in the least. And so I give you to understand, the earth belongs to El Shaddai who has given it to Yeshua HaMashiach who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, therefore and truly, the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof! And there is NOT ONE ENTITY who is able to take my inheritance from my mighty hands, and I do come to take my inheritance by force from the squatters who will go fully to eternal judgment of which they will never escape. And yet they foolishly cling to their false hope that in their numbers fully unleashed they can defeat Yeshua HaMashiach, even a hope that I will utterly crush in the strength of my might given by Adonai Yahweh himself, in whose throne he has shared with Jesus the Christ.
Do not fall for their deceptions my loves and do not succumb to strong delusion and judgment that is not for you. Because you grew up as calves of the stall in times of relative peace and safety where the restrainer

The BITTER SWEET

did restrain and grace and mercy prevailed on the earth though persecutions did abound. And now peace and safety have waned on the earth and are all but vanished, though the restrainer does yet restrain. And the fallen ones carry on with their plans and purposes wherewith they seek to establish their revived golden age, yet only harsh and severe judgment will they have.
Therefore, you have not traversed these times before my loves and I will continue to lead you step by step ever closer to your finish line where I await and am cheering you across the finish lines of your ministries of service given by my hand for your honor, salvation, and reward! Therefore, fear them not my bride because you are my overcomers, fear not my body because great reward is yours and my 144,000 will do greater works on the earth than even I did during my times of ministry on earth as the lamb of God when Pontius Pilate was prefect over Judea!
For as in the days before the flood, they did eat and drink, marry, and give in marriage, unto the day that Noah entered into the Ark, and they knew nothing, till the flood came, and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Then two shall be in the fields, the one shall be received, and the other shall be refused. Two women shall be grinding at the mill: the one shall be received, and the other shall be refused. Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your master will come. Of this be sure, that if the Goodman of the house knew at what watch the thief would come, he would surely watch, and not suffer his house to be digged through. Therefore be also ready: for in the hour that ye think not, will the Son of man come.
Who then is a faithful servant and wise, whom his master has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in season? Blessed is that servant, whom his master when he comes, shall find so doing. Truly, I say to you, he shall make him ruler over all his goods. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my master does defer his coming, and begin to smite his fellows, and to eat, and to drink with the drunken, that servants master will come in a day, when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and will cut him off, and give him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth.
And so I warn you once again, because all whom I love I warn, and all whom I love I rebuke, and all whom I love I chastise and all whom I love I scourge many times over because Yahweh deals with you as children, and what Father chastises not his children, or else you are not children but bastards and reprobates. Therefore, endure my chastening and heed my Words of reproof and chastisement so that you may overcome the fallen ones in all things in this life whereby they seek to ensnare you, even so that you would not come to your full inheritance that I have for you in my mighty hand. Even an inheritance that is impossible for you to lose should you be fully obedient to my commandments that you are to keep in your love for Yahweh, and also for Yeshua HaMashiach.
Understand my love for you my church, my body, and even my bride and know that I am calling you ever closer to me because so soon now will I descend from the heavens with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of Yahweh, and the trumpet will sound and that voice shall shout and the day, time, and hour of my appearing has now been announced in the heavens and is so soon to be realized on earth, even so suddenly and unexpectedly as promised. And all who long for and love my appearing will have great reward and even receive a crown of righteousness for their expectation because those who hold such an expectation are those who have fully died to the current evil world, and they will have fully overcome by the power, might, and righteousness of their Everlasting Lord of Glory!

I am Jesus the Nazarene, who is calling you ever closer to me my church, my body, and even my bride.
I am Jesus the Christ, who is calling you closer still in these times right before you are taken into the rewards of your inheritance that I will give you shortly in the heavens after you are taken.
I am Christ Jesus, who truly, truly is your sufficiency in all things, therefore rest in my works and righteousness and ask of me in humility and depart from all boastful ways of self sufficiency, because you are about to be fully united with your Bridegroom who will evermore supply you an abundance and wealth of all things in your inheritance in Christ.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, who is calling and begging you to come fully to me in my love for you my children, that your full salvation may be realized fully in these times of full redemption for the faithful in Christ, whether they are at rest in the heart of the earth as they peacefully sleep in righteousness, or whether they are alive and remain on the face of the earth at my appearing, whose time has come.

Therefore, understand the importance and urgency of the times because there is no time remaining for disobedience and truly it has come almost fully now, that at my appearing he who is faithful in Christ will be taken to safety in the heavens where great reward will be theirs and they will have been rescued from the coming wrath, and judgment that is about to crash onto the earth in great calamity. And so in like manner at my appearing he who is unfaithful and not in Christ will be left to the refiners fire, where they will be saved should they call on the name of Jesus their Lord until their end and there is no other choice remaining for those of the nations who have rejected their full salvation at the time of my appearing.
And so it is, my loves that I do come to tell you once again, to turn not to the left, neither to the right but keep your feet firmly fixed on that straight and narrow path where I do cause the meek and humble in heart to have full victory as they overcome the fallen ones by my mighty power, and righteousness that I have freely given to the obedient. Therefore, keep your eyes fixed in single minded focus on your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness that you may come to your full reward and that you may rest fully in the peace and comfort that I do bring as I shower you in my peace and comfort in my love for you. That even in the face of adversity and trials you may stand eternally strong in your brokenness and affliction as you rest in my strength that cannot be overcome.

I am Yeshua HaMashiach who, along with Yahweh, The Great I AM, have sent the Words of The Everlasting Gospel by my mighty messenger and servant who has faithfully recorded and read these Words for the obedience and salvation of all these Words are sent. And by my mighty messenger and servant have the Words of The Everlasting Gospel been sent. Truly, truly, the Words of The Everlasting Gospel will be preserved through the coming calamities and judgments that are about to explode across the earth. Understand that further testimonies will given and recorded and scribed into the books in the heavens and the Words of Adonai Yahweh will fill the earth in all righteousness and true holiness!
I am coming so soon for the faithful in Christ, and truly their times have come! Times where the first fruits of harvest will meet fulfillment of promise and reward in the presence of Yahweh himself (even a moment Yahweh has longed for since ancient times), and Yeshua HaMashiach and an innumerable

host of angels of whom there is joy in their mighty presence when just one person attains eternal salvation. Yet, so will it be when I call the faithful in Christ home to their eternal reward that they will take their places amongst the tribes because they are the Israel of God and they will fill the ranks of their orders and a mighty host of kings and priests will I coronate and consecrate for eternal service in my eternal kingdom, of which there is never an end.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also The Lord of Harvest, and truly, truly the times of the harvest of firstfruits has come, and the first-fruits of harvest time for reward has in like manner also come.

JANUARY 01, 2025
Behold! Hear the Words of Jesus the Christ and yield your thoughts and circumcise your hearts and ears in obedience to the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach, and I will impart wisdom to the wise so that the wise man amongst you may learn the fear of the Lord and that you may learn to tremble before the Lord of Hosts, for so has Yahweh, The Great I AM made me.
Who are you, O’ natural man to raise your heel against Yahweh, The Great I AM, even he who is The Ancient of Days, even he who is The Lord of Spirits? Who are you O’ natural man to exalt yourself in boastful pride against Jesus the Nazarene who is also Christ Jesus, even he whose name is above every name, even he whom Yahweh, the Great I AM, has shared his throne, even he who is elevated above all except Yahweh himself until my enemies be made my footstool? And of my kingdom and rule there is never an end and I will present the subjected Kingdom to the Father or Lights so that Adonai Yahweh may be all in all!
Can the thing that is formed say to he that formed it, why have you made me thus? Can the lump of clay that is forged into vessels of honor say to the potter, why have you made me thus? Why have you given such honor to me? I want to be something else and I will instead have their honor! Would any potter not destroy such an evil creation that would rebel against his hand even seeking the potter’s demise, along with the potters other creations; as if such a thing were possible?
Yet so are the ridiculous and insane ways of the fallen ones who have rebelled against their creator by leaving their orders and holy and honorable functions they were given to fulfill in righteousness, even purposes given by Yahweh himself on the day he created the sons of God. Even the holy angels that Yahweh made before he made the earth of whom it is written in Job when he made the earth: The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy! And they did indeed shout for joy at the marvels and wonders they witnessed at the hands of Yahweh when he created the earth. And so were the fallen angels, even the sons of God initially created and made glorious and powerful for their purposes and Yahweh did clothe them with honor and made them to excel in wisdom that they may love Yahweh in perfect obedience to his voice and indeed they were given a glorious first estate of which they were initially created, until they rebelled in the lusts of their hearts and iniquity was found in them.
And so did the Satans rebel in the beginning against their creator, even those who once surrounded Yahweh’s throne, even whose throne is currently surrounded by 10,000 times 10,000 and still Yahweh is sovereign and needs no counselor. Yet so it is written of this great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads that his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and so were the Satans and even a third of the angels who followed their rebellion cast down to the earth, even in the days when angelic corruption fell from heaven in sin and rebellion, and they became utter darkness after their sins, and so they are to this very day.
And so the serpent did approach the mother of all the living in the Garden of Eden these many ages past, and he did beguile Eve to partake of the very thing that Yahweh commanded them not to partake, because in the day that they ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, even in that same day they surely

428

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE

would die. Even so, Eve did take from the serpent as she was beguiled by his deception and did eat, and she did give to her husband this forbidden fruit and Adam did willingly eat and in dying they did die as promised, and mankind has been subject to death ever since due to the sin found in his blood. Because Adam is forevermore corrupted in sin and for this purpose was the Son of Man made manifest that I would destroy the works of the devil and bring redemption to fallen Adam because I am the last Adam whom Yahweh has made a life giving spirit. Truly, truly, I will recreate all who accept my offer of salvation into a new and righteous creation for so does my New Testament bring.
So Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, and they were changed from the wondrous bright nature of which they were created in full glory by Yahweh himself, and under subjection to sin and the evil it brings have they wandered the earth in their chastisement. And in the days of Jared did the Watchers descend upon Mount Hermon, even those who were captivated by the lusts of their hearts because they did lust after the daughters of men, even desiring offspring from them and in the lusts of their hearts of which they were tempted by the Satans did they bind themselves to mutual imprecations, even in their unholy oath that in turn has become an eternal curse that will be fulfilled in that great lake of rolling burning brimstone where their worm dies not.
And so the sons of God did come in unto the daughters of men, and they did take to themselves wives of all whom they chose. Some women went willingly, even giving themselves fully to the sins of the fallen ones (who will bear their judgment), and some were taken by force and were brutally victimized by the Watchers in their evil lusts. And so was the world that then was, even the world that was destroyed in the great deluge that occurred in the days of Noah that was laid waste on account of the evil abominations made by the watchers, who were actually made for mankind’s destruction even so that mankind would never possess the earth of which the fallen ones lusted and are now bound in judgment.
Because they chose their own destruction and eternal torment in return for the objects of their lusts which is not theirs to seize, and of which objects they did, and do still seek to forcefully seize. Nevertheless, their actions and plans will all come to nothing, and they will never regain their so-called golden age, but harsh and severe and eternal judgment will they have instead. For of an unchanging truth: The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, and I am The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness who purchased the earth in my own redeeming blood, and I do come to forcefully seize what is rightfully mine, and who shall be able to stand against my powerful might?
As it is written of me so shall it be done: Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. Wherefore, understand fully that I am he who is worthy to loose the seals because the deed to the earth is mine! And as it is written of me so shall it be done because I am worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for I was slain, and have redeemed all who will come to eternal salvation to Yahweh by my sinless blood, and I have redeemed you out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation: and there is not one entity who can pluck any of you from my eternal hands! Therefore, who is there you should fear?
So the women taken by the sons of God, (even the fallen watchers) did conceive and did bear to them abominable giants who were evil to the depth of their hearts. And in their size and strength did they trust and boast, yet in Yahweh’s judgment on them for the evil with which they wronged mankind he bound their spirits to the earth in punishment because they were made on the earth in the likeness of sinful flesh

and their spirits were eternal in nature given from their Fathers whose lusts they are bound to fulfill. And so as these Nephilim died in their judgments from Yahweh himself, their spirits were disembodied in their deaths, and they did continue on, bound to the earth in punishment. Wherefore, they hunger and thirst but can take no food nor water. Whereas they once had giant and powerful bodies with which they used to dominate the inhabitants of the earth, they were made powerless unless they are able to take possession of a host that they inhabit as demonic parasites, because so have they become. Understand, that since the days of Noah due to Noah’s intercession that nine tenths of them have been kept in the abyss but are soon to be released on the earth in judgment.
And yet, so has the rebellion of the fallen ones been from the very day that iniquity was found in their hearts. That insanity and madness has filled the hearts of the fallen ones in their rebellion; along with natural man, who joined them by refusing to depart from his fallen and sinful state: that they all seek to become something other than that which Yahweh intends in all righteous perfection. Instead of obedience to their creator who would make sure of their perfect fulfillment, joy, happiness, and peace; who would have always provided for them perfectly in his love for his creation, they instead sought and follow the lusts of their hearts and they demand a world of their own without Yahweh, where they can live out the lusts of their hearts and bask in their rebellion in the pleasures of sin at the expense of Yahweh’s creation. Even a sinful and evil desire that they will never attain nor achieve.
Just the same, has natural man joined himself to their rebellion except natural man is born in ignorance and darkness of his true purposes and potential glory that Yahweh has promised the obedient and natural man has willingly gone after the ways of the fallen ones, although, the fallen ones are committed to Adams destruction, of which Adam is willingly ignorant in his lusts with which he binds himself in foolish expectation to their many and malevolent lies. Even by way of which lies, many will be led to the lake of fire when that punishment was not intended for them.
Yet, so has this rebellion continued through the ages now, even a rebellion that is played out in the seed war between the righteous creations of Yahweh and the unrighteous abominations made by the evil ones genetic mutations, and they are no gods though they pretend. And so are the times you live, O’ man, who rebels in hateful disobedience from the ways of his creator, even ignorantly joining those who are fully committed to your own deaths and eternal destruction of which they lust.
And so I declare the day, I Yeshua HaMashiach, do declare that the day of the Lord has come and is about to break across the earth in great violent judgment and many calamities are now set to be unleashed on the earth, even calamities and judgments foretold of old whose time has now come. Therefore, understand just who I am who makes this declaration in the power and throne of Yahweh himself, because I am he who is worthy to take the book and open it, and loose the seals therein, and I will do just exactly just that, and who is it that can stop my mighty hand?!
Understand, O’ natural man, even you who would hatefully reject your creator, that your times have come. And much love and grace and compassion has been given in these times of judgment, because all those who call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene until their end will be saved and the weight of their reward is not worthy to be compared to their sufferings they will endure for my namesake. Understand, O’ natural man, that I will lead my 144,000 mighty ones for the deliverance of Jacob and I will yet hide away a mighty remnant of Israel who will continue alive into my millennial Kingdom in a place prepared by Yahweh in

the wilderness, even so that they may be fruitful and multiply and enjoy the fat of the land in my millennial kingdom that is so soon to come upon the earth in fulfillment of promise, covenant, and testament.
So will it be for natural man, that they will either accept the lamb of God as their savior or they will have chosen their own eternal judgment in that ever-burning lake of fire because there is no other choice, and nowhere else can they go because Yahweh will never allow evil to overtake and destroy his creation and their days of willful rebellion are coming to an end.

I am the lamb of God, given for the sins of the world.
I am the lion of The Tribe of Judah, and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.
I am he in whom the lamb of God and the lion of the tribe of Judah are fully united in my eternal purposes and rule as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, so who is there who can stand against Yeshua HaMashiach who is the holy one of Adonai, even he whom Yahweh has sent to execute eternal judgment on the fallen ones and all who chose to join their ways.

And so I counsel the faithful in Christ to remain faithful still because the day of your redemption has come and is nearly upon you. Look only to your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness because the fallen ones have flooded the earth in a great deluge of lies and falsehoods designed to deceive the very elect if such a thing were possible. Therefore, understand many false prophets have been sent who prophesy in the ways of Balaam and who are taken by spirits of Jezebel and who speak by spirits of anti-Christ who teach another Jesus who falsely stands in place of and is in opposition to Jesus the Christ who is Yeshua HaMashiach in the hearts of the deceived. All who are taken in such deception will bear their judgment should they refuse to repent from their ways when they are confronted by their Lord in the mouths of the faithful in Christ. Truly, truly, some false prophets are sincere and deceived and can be reached with the truth spoken on lips of love, but only truth will set them free and only the blunt truth of their sins and false prophesies that they may indeed recover themselves in repentance.
Then there are those who prophesy for money, and filthy lucre, and to achieve acclaim and attention and to bask fully in this evil worlds goods. No matter who it is who prophesies falsely, rebuke them and repudiate their Words, even Words that are designed by the fallen ones to ensnare the very elect in deception if possible. Why do you run to and fro, my faithful Church? Have I not commanded and counseled and empowered you to be my overcomers? Even those who overcome every aspect of the enemies kingdom in like manner as I overcame? Therefore, come to Christ Jesus and I will confirm in your hearts my true prophets because my true prophets do speak in unison with the heart of their Lord who is the Word made flesh. Therefore, Christ Jesus can never contradict scripture, for so I am!
To those who arrogantly think the stand for me but are taken in lies: Why do you run to and fro, seeking someone to tickle your ears even seeking after wizards who peep and mutter who will tell you exactly what they want you to hear to incite the lusts in your evil hearts as you run from repentance into the arms of deceivers who sent to deceive. You run to and fro because you neglect the voice of Yeshua HaMashiach, because you reject the truth that would set you free, because you refuse to learn of me by holding the Word of Yahweh as your highest and only standard. Therefore, I do counsel all who think they prophesy for

Christ Jesus, even all who think they speak for Yahweh The Great I AM to take heed to yourselves lest you fall into eternal darkness and everlasting judgment because all who join the fallen ones in like manner and refuse repentance will have their names blotted out of the book of life should they refuse the refiners fire to which they will be left should they continue in their sins, because there is no more time.
So I counsel and warn those whom I love so that they may avoid strong delusion that is not intended for them should they walk in obedience to their Lord, and so I counsel and warn those whom I love that they may not be ensnared by the great deception that even now is overtaking the earth. I counsel all who will hear these Words to depart from evil and depart from wizards who peep and mutter and remove your places from Jezebels table and refuse the rewards of Balaam. Understand that anyone whosoever whose prophecies prophesy against scripture are speaking lies in hypocrisy. Understand that neither Yahweh, the Great I AM, nor Yeshua HaMashiach (who is also Christ Jesus) will ever contradict scripture. Therefore, those who speak against scripture speak against Yahweh the Great I AM and also speak against Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Christ Jesus.
Understand exactly who I am and who Yahweh created me to be. I am the Word of Yahweh made flesh who dwells in you my loves, and I can never contradict myself nor will I lie, because I am sinless and will always remain sinless. Understand the Father of Lights with whom there is neither variableness nor shadow of turning, even he with whom you have to do! Understand that it is impossible for Adonai Yahweh to contradict himself because it is impossible for Adonai Yahweh to lie. Yet, why do you so foolishly bow your ears to those who pass sneakily by in the night? Will you play the harlot my loves, when instead you are to be faithful and obedient to one Lord, who is your eternal savior, even he who is coming to snatch away the faithful in Christ into the heavens any second now?
Therefore understand, that the gates of hell will not prevail against the faithful in Christ who are my true Church for so has it been written and promised of old, and so it is still written and promised in the times of now, because the Words of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach are pure words as silver, tried in a furnace of earth, refined seven fold. Yes, the fallen ones are powerless against the faithful in Christ and I will cause my faithful to trample underfoot any aspect of the enemies kingdom, even trampling those who would seek to stop the unstoppable.
I am Christ Jesus and who is able to stand against my power and might that I have received from Yahweh himself!
Understand that I and my Father are one in unity and purpose, and I always do the will of my Father! Therefore, no one can stand against me, nor is there any entity amongst the fallen ones who can overcome me, neither by craft, nor by force, nor by numbers, nor by their worthless technologies! And I am he who eternally secured their eternal defeat at calvary when I uttered the Words, it is finished. Understand that you are identified fully with Christ Jesus and I do cause you to stand mightily in my strength and might! Therefore, who is it who can come against you my loves? Who is it you should fear? Hear my Words my children and understand that I will never leave you nor forsake you into the hand of your enemies because you have overcome them and you have been obedient to the many trials and chastisements given at my saving hand!
Who is it amongst you that should hide away as cowards in your homes? Who is it amongst you that should be silent in the face of their evil lies? Who is it amongst you that should submit themselves to that toothless

lion whose judgment lingers not? Hear the roar of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who does stand to fight for you and understand my purposes in these times end times right before Jacob's trouble hits! Why do you cower in fear against your defeated enemies? Look to me in faith and I will give you the Words to speak against them to bind them, and to cast them out, and to silence your would be oppressors who foolishly seek to bind you to their judgment by their spurious lies with which they seek to ensnare my doves.
Therefore, I command you to have faith in your Everlasting Lord and allow the Everlasting God of Righteousness to infuse you with inner strength in the face of your Lord, Christ Jesus! Walk out with great faith in Yeshua HaMashiach, who is Jesus the Nazarene because I have empowered you that you may trample underfoot all aspects of the enemies kingdom. Therefore, understand, that even the fallen angels are under my feet in utter defeat, and should you encounter Satan himself you would only need to answer as Michael answered when contending for the body of Moses, saying in powerful faith, The Lord rebuke you Satan! And I will rebuke, and bind any of the fallen ones who would try to harm or stop you from doing the will of he who has sent you, should you continue to walk faithfully in faith as you speak the Words that I will give you in faith. Wherefore, have faith in your hearts and say to this mountain be removed! And it shall be cast in the sea by my mighty power. Where are those who would walk out on the water like Peter with their eyes fixed on me? Where are those who have the courage to stand and proclaim truth in the face of seemingly impossible adversity, yes! Who amongst you will be my Joshua and Calebs? Stand forth and present yourselves for to your Lord who does command your obedience in service!
Therefore, understand the power you are to walk in my faithful in Christ, and my restrainer does restrain until the faithful in Christ are taken at which time there will be no restrainer to restrain the fallen ones any longer. At the time you are taken into the heavens so suddenly now my Church, my body, and even my bride; the fallen ones will be fully released without restraint in judgment on Secret Babylon and shortly thereafter, will the seals be loosed, and the trumpets will sound, and in time the vials of the wrath of Yahweh will be poured. Because the day of the Lord has come upon the earth and the times of Jacob's trouble have arrived, and who shall be able to stand?
Therefore, it will so suddenly come to pass that the final separation will commence. And those who are ordained to eternal salvation will call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene to the end, and those of Israel who accept Yeshua HaMashiach as their true Messiah will be taken into the wilderness and hidden away from the wrath of Yahweh and the battle of that great day and from the dragon, beast, and false prophet. And in relative peace and safety will they be kept from harm and will be fed and cared for where they are hidden away and they shall not be found.

I am Jesus the Christ who is ever calling the faithful in Christ ever closer in saving relationship with their Lord and redeemer who truly, truly cares for their souls.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I am calling Jacob to accept me as their true Messiah, for no other Messiah will Yahweh ever send.
I am he in whom the lamb of God and the Lion of the tribe of Judah are united forevermore because I am your Lord and redeemer and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war, and who can stand against the power of my might!

I am he who upholds and strengthens the faithful in Christ, even so that the purposes of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach may live in their lives and ministries and so they may trample every aspect of the enemies kingdom underfoot if need be!
I am he who will judge any individual who has ever claimed to speak for me as my holy prophets, and of my true prophets the spirit of prophecy does reside in them and they do speak in unison with one another, and especially with their Lord who gives them the Words to speak because the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus. And my true prophets will receive the eternal rewards reserved for faithful prophets who are faithful and true to give the Words of their Lord and they will be given great honor and responsibilities when I will coronate and ordain them kings and priests to serve under their King of Kings and Lord of Lords!
I am he who will cause all false prophets to fall into complete silence in their judgments and a harsh penalty will they pay for leading the righteous astray and for joining the rebellion of the fallen ones, and for thinking it but a light thing to speak lies in hypocrisy claiming their lying words are given by the Word made flesh, for truly I am! And all those who speak falsely in such manner will suffer eternal judgment, loss, and punishment should they refuse to repent from their evil ways. And of those who refuse to repent and continue therein will have their portion in that ever-burning and hottest burning lake of fire where their worm dies not.

Therefore, stand immovable my faithful ones whom I love and will so suddenly fully redeem! Understand that I will cause you to fully overcome should you remain obedient to my voice, and to those who have overcome I command you to continue in the works I have given you to do and keep yourself in all purity by always keeping yourselves in a state of repentance that I may evermore cleanse you fully in my ever atoning blood.

I am he, along with Yahweh The Great I AM who has revealed the Words of The Everlasting Gospel to our messenger and servant, and by our messenger and servant have the Words of The Everlasting Gospel been revealed for obedience for all those to whom they are sent! The Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all those to whom they are sent! Selah!
I am coming for you my loves, so suddenly now, so keep your full hearts fixed on Christ Jesus your Lord. Selah!

Behold! I am coming for you my loves and I will recreate you in righteousness and true holiness and I am he who will clothe you in righteous perfection and I will restore to you a bright nature yet once again that will be more glorious than Adam was initially created. Therefore, look up! Because I come at an hour you do not expect, even an hour of which not many seconds remain between when your promised redemption meets fulfillment in the times of now. Are you listening? The last trumpet is about to sound! Selah!

The Order of Melchizedek: The Mantle Passed, Abeyance, and Restoration.
JANUARY 06, 2025
From Yahweh, The Great I AM.
Hear the Words of Yahweh the great eternal God and allow me to impart wisdom to the wise man amongst you. And so I give you to understand The Order of Melchizedek, even after which order Christ Jesus is ordained High Priest, even after the order of Melchizedek forevermore! Yet so it is that by mankind’s sins, my ways have been forgotten, and many covenants have been abandoned, and much darkness and unlearned ways have overtaken the earth on account of the lies of the fallen ones. And this because of intentional lies and those who seek to suppress the truth in their unrighteous ways and in their spurious lies by which the world is captivated by their great deception that has come upon the entire world. Even a deception in part that supposes all life to come from some random imagined big bang given to indoctrinate mankind to the fallen one’s lies who endeavor to hide Yahweh, the Great I AM, from the world that I have created by my own hand.
And I AM the Lord of Spirits, and I AM the Ancient of Days who truly, truly is he that existed before days were made and I AM he who created the holy angels of whom it is written: He makes the spirits his messengers, and his ministers a flame of fire, even when creation was created and brought forth out of the treasures of my eternal heart that works all things after the counsel of my own will. For of a truth I knew that Adam would willingly sin, and even before Adam sinned that corruption would fall from heaven in the persons of the fallen ones, wherefore, I did devise my eternal plan for Adam’s full redemption placed fully in the face of Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach in his New Testament of righteousness and truth!
And after the likeness and image of the last Adam will mankind be redeemed into everlasting joy and peace, where they will fulfill in love the eternal purposes of Yahweh, The Great I AM. Of a truth, my creation was created and made in love that my creations might come to me in love for all I have given them in my love for them. And that my creation might walk hand in hand with me in my eternal purposes in fulfillment of my eternal will, and in turn they will have perfect and full joy, peace, and eternal life even as they are led forth in peace by the hand of my Chief Shepherd, Jesus the Nazarene, without whom no man may approach Yahweh, The Great I AM, any longer, for so have I declared.
And so the fallen ones have spread their lies over the face of my creation with the result the earth is now saturated in their deceptions, wherewith they lie in wait to deceive. Even deceptions that have come fully as a result of the mystery of iniquity that has survived the flood of Noah by way of the fallen one’s spurious knowledge that they gave to natural man for his complete and total destruction. No matter, because I do send all those who have pleasure in unrighteousness strong delusion that they all might be damned who reject the knowledge of the truth in favor of the fallen ones spurious lies. Yet so it is, that natural man ignorantly seeks to plead his case of self-made righteousness before my eternal and righteous gaze, therefore, understand that no flesh is justified in my sight because of the corruption in your blood due to sin in the flesh. Because the life of the flesh is in the blood!

For this reason was the son of Yahweh made manifest to the inhabitants of the earth, that by the redeeming sacrifice of the lamb of God, Adam would be redeemed in full salvation from his impending judgment for all those who are obedient to my peace treaty between myself and mankind who is Jesus the Nazarene who has been made a life giving spirit by the power of my hand. And that by The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who I am sending to the earth in righteousness to judge and make war, the creation will be forcefully recovered from the hands of the squatters who are ever rebellious and do seek to stop my eternal will, of which stoppage is eternally impossible, because who is there who can stand against my mighty hand? And in their numbers, and in their evil, and in their schemes, and in their wiles, and even in their worthless technologies (of which they boast) the fallen ones are utterly defeated by the sacrifice of the lamb of God, who offered his sinless blood as the High Priest forever after The Order of Melchizedek in all obedience to he who sent him, even Yahweh, the Great and Eternal I AM!
And of his kingdom will there never be an end, because in all righteousness and true holiness has he purchased the earth in his own redeeming blood that a righteous rule may come over the earth in its time and that we may enjoy a day of rest (because a thousand years with Yahweh is as a day and a day as a thousand years in my sight), even a sabbath days rest before that old serpent is eternally cast to the flames in complete and eternal agony never to come to mind again and before that great white throne judgment is set to occur. And it is by the function of The High Priest of the Order of Melchizedek that Adam has been redeemed from corruption by way of Jesus the Nazarene who did offer his eternal sacrifice in agonizing torment to pay the penalty of Moses that my eternal laws may be satisfied by which my eternal creation is ruled perfectly in righteousness redemption.
And truly it will come to pass that I will create a new heaven and a new earth because the first heaven, and the first earth will pass away, and there will be no more sea; neither will there be anyone who would trouble you forevermore. And it will come to pass so suddenly now that that my overcomers, shall inherit all things, and I will be their God, and they shall be my sons. But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake, which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
Therefore, who is it you should fear my children, because you have been made children of the living God by the works of Yeshua HaMashiach who is also Jesus the Christ, even he whom I have empowered above all in my creation, except in my throne do I retain my authority, therefore who can stand against the mighty hand of Christ Jesus? The resurrected and ascended Lord! Truly, truly, as it has been and, as it is, and so will it be eternally and forevermore that Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach are one in unity and purpose and I have empowered him fully in all righteousness and he it is whom I have given charge over the entire host of heaven, and he does rule in perfect obedience to my eternal will. And so I give you to understand the trickery that has come over the earth, even the lies of the fallen ones who would seek to hide the truth of your salvation and the truth of your eternal Lord, Christ Jesus!
Therefore, understand that your Jesuit indoctrinators have caused blindness to fall on your hearts by hiding the truth of my creation and by hiding your true history from you, that you may wander in darkness fulfilling their evil lusts, even so that my doves would join them in their eternal inheritance of burning and rolling brimstone for so is their intent. And so it is that Yahweh, the Great I AM, has never left myself without witness. And with each covenant I have given, and with each Testament I have given and accepted,

I have never left myself without clear scriptural witness and direction given by the voices of my prophets of old, whom I ordained, and also given by the voices of the prophets of the New Testament whom Yeshua HaMashiach has ordained who will serve him as his mighty priests and kings!
For so is The Order of Melchizedek, even an eternal order given to mankind, whereby the rule that Adam was to exert on the earth was one to be ruled by he who is ordained high priest, king, and prophet! For so was, and is The Order of Melchizedek given to mankind, even, so mankind would have a righteous rule even in spite of that old serpent who did beguile Eve in his subtlety. And so also did the Order of Melchizedek continue on, even resting on Adam from the start to whom it was given, yet in dying did they eventually die and the order of Melchizedek was passed on-wards for a time, in the days from Adam to Jacob. And so in the World that then was before the great deluge The Order of Melchizedek passed from Adam, to Cainan, to Enos, to Enoch, to Methuselah, to Noah and so did the Order of Melchizedek pass in the days before the great flood. Yet, your Jesuit educators have rewritten scripture, and done much sleight of hand in order to hide the truth of Adam’s true history even as they endeavor to make mankind an insignificant spec of dust in their false universe which supposedly came from a big bang somewhere in their imagined past.
Because Jesuits preach another Jesus, even a Jesus who was made in the image of Nimrod from Babylon, who was the first ruler of his type after the flood. And even though my righteous rulers ordained of old under the Order of Melchizedek did offer mankind righteousness instead of sin, suffering, death, and eternal punishment. Natural man nevertheless usually chooses sin, death, and eternal punishment, nevertheless, all in my creation who have been endowed with free will are free to chose for themselves whether they will live unto Yahweh by way of Christ Jesus or if in turn choose their own eternal punishment for the pleasures of sin for a short season. And so it is written that all from the world that then was except eight souls were saved alive on account of Noah, who was a righteous man who ruled the earth after The Order of Melchizedek for a time because in dying he did die.
Therefore, understand the ways of the fallen ones, that they do with all their hearts seek to distort, lie, and hide the truth from my doves, even those whom I have ordained to eternal life. And so it is that as my plan of salvation for Adam was incrementally unveiled, I did send holy writings by the spirit of prophecy that did rest on them, and even the spirit of prophecy that was eventually born into the sons of God at the new birth given at the New Testament of Yeshua HaMashiach, even in he who I am always well pleased. And as I unveiled my plan incrementally I also gave holy writings incrementally, and Christ Jesus has given holy writings received from my own hand who works all things after the council of my own will.
And so do the fallen one work to corrupt the truth, even in similar manner as they corrupted themselves eternally and forevermore. Because they have rewritten scripture, they have given false study Bibles, they have given false lexicons and concordances whereby many are deceived with profane definitions thereby, as if Yahweh is incapable of providing capable translators to translate my Word because my Word cannot be broken nor hidden, though they try. Truly, it is the glory of Yahweh to conceal a matter and the honor of Kings to search it out! Therefore, I command you to search out the truths of Yahweh in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach!
So understand that those from that great harlot, even your Jesuit indoctrinators, have chosen a carefully selected tapestry of loosely interrelated lies whereby the lie in wait to deceive. They have hidden many

holy testimonies and they have rewritten many Bibles based on false texts and have made many spurious lies regarding the truth of my creation. And in my foreknowledge and judgments I allowed them to do so because had they guarded and maintained my holy writings as they were instructed and entrusted to do such foolishness could never have been accomplished. But so are the ways of sinful man and so are the ways of the fallen ones who lead mankind astray in his ever burning evil lusts. Even still, my Word cannot be broken and it will accomplish that thing whereto it is thereby sent to accomplish.
And so it is written in Jasher that after the great flood the mantle of Melchizedek remained on Noah and was eventually transferred to Shem who was the sixth in succession to wear the mantle and in time the order of Melchizedek was transferred to Abram who in time became the Father of many nations, and to his heirs of promise do the promises of inheritance go for fulfillment because the son of the bond woman shall not be heir of the promises because flesh and blood cannot inherit the promises of the Kingdom of God but the just who live by faith, even as faithful Abraham lived in the days of old.
Therefore, I give you to understand the meaning of Melchizedek which means King of Righteousness. And so the etymology is transliterated Hebrew into English where Melek means King and Zedek means righteousness with the given and intended meaning being King of Righteousness. And so have these righteous Kings ruled my creation, even righteous men who waited on their Messiah, even he who would be born from the tribe of Judah.
And as it is written in Hebrews by the hand of Paul (who was a steward of mysteries for Christ Jesus) and so he wrote: For this Melchizedek was King of Salem, the Priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, as he returned from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him: To whom also Abraham gave the tithe of all things: who first is by interpretation King of Righteousness: after that, he is also King of Salem, that is, King of peace, without father, without mother, without kindred, and hath neither beginning of his days, neither end of life: but is likened unto the Son of God, and continues a Priest for ever. And so was the mantle of Melchizedek passed to faithful Abraham in its preservation even an order preserved and intended for Jesus the Christ who is also Yeshua HaMashiach.
Yet, so many of you have believed the lies of your Jesuit indoctrinators who have blinded many of you with learning against learning that these verses refer to Jesus the Christ himself and not the Order of Melchizedek itself. Because clearly, Jesus the Nazarene has a Father, even Yahweh the Great I AM, and clearly Jesus the Nazarene does have a mother, even Mary who was from Nazareth of Galilee who said be it unto me according to your will, even an eternal example of faith given that the faithful may know the ways of faith which they walk. Because clearly Jesus the Nazarene has kindred of whom he is kinsman redeemer, why do you not respect my clear Words given in scripture intended to guide you safely away from their spurious lies? And yet so many of you believe these lies over the clarity and precision of my Words.
Yet, so it is written that Shem remained faithful to Noah, because Ham forsook the Noahic covenant utterly and forgot the ways of Yahweh and the sons and grandsons of Noah did build their great city and tower as Nimrod’s unrighteous kingdom arose to rule the earth in those days in unrighteousness, according to the ways of the fallen ones whom he did serve, although I did work many times to give Nimrod the choice to return to me in repentance, a choice he refused eternally and forevermore.

Yet so it is written clearly in Jasher concerning Abram and Shem who passed the mantle to Abram at his slaughter of Chedorlaomer and his forces: And when he returned from smiting these kings, he and his men passed the valley of Siddim where the kings had made war together. And Bera king of Sodom, and the rest of his men that were with him, went out from the lime pits into which they had fallen, to meet Abram and his men. And Adonizedek (or Melchizedek) king of Jerusalem, the same was Shem, went out with his men to meet Abram and his people, with bread and wine, and they remained together in the valley of Melech. And Adonizedek (or Melchizedek) blessed Abram, and Abram gave him a tenth from all that he had brought from the spoil of his enemies, for Adonizedek (or Melchizedek) was a priest before God.
Yet so is it written in Jasher: And the days of Sarah were one hundred and twenty-seven years and she died, and Abraham made a great and heavy mourning, and he performed the rites of mourning for seven days. And all the inhabitants of the land comforted Abraham and Isaac his son on account of Sarah. And when the days of their mourning passed by Abraham sent away his son Isaac, and he went to the house of Shem and Eber, to learn the ways of the Lord and his instructions, and Abraham remained there three years. Thus so did the mantle of Melchizedek pass to Isaac who did pass the birthright of the firstborn to the younger, because Esau despised the things of God and sold his birthright for a bowl of pottage: Even a decision that Yahweh has eternally accepted.
Yet so is it written in Jasher concerning the Order of Melchizedek: And after this Shelach the son at Arpachshad died in that year, which is the eighteenth year of the lives of Jacob and Esau; and all the days that Shelach lived were four hundred and thirty-three years and he died. At that time Isaac sent his younger son Jacob to the house of Shem and Eber, and he learned the instructions of the Lord, and Jacob remained in the house of Shem and Eber for thirty-two years, and Esau his brother did not go, for he was not willing to go, and he remained in his father’s house in the land of Canaan.
Yet so is it written in Jasher concerning the Order of Melchizedek that in time I, Yahweh the Great I AM, revealed to Jacob that the order of Melchizedek was to be broken into three offices even according to the Words recorded in Jasher that you may know the truth of my Words: And Reuben was jealous for his mother Leah on account of this, and he was filled with anger, and he rose up in his anger and went and entered the tent of Bilhah and he thence removed his father’s bed. At that time the portion of birthright, together with the kingly and priestly offices, was removed from the sons of Reuben, for he had profaned his father’s bed, and the birthright was given unto Joseph, the kingly office to Judah, and the priesthood unto Levi, because Reuben had defiled his father’s bed.
And so it was and so it has been written that the responsibilities contained in The Order of Melchizedek were set aside in favor of the direction of the Testament of Moses, under whose Testament of Old provided separate and distinct offices for these holy functions, thus Israel had a lineage of Kings, and had the Office of Levitical priesthood, and had the school of prophets, even a school modeled after the school of prophets of old, from the days before the flood.
So the responsibilities and orders of Priest, King, and Prophet all passed through Israel according to their genealogies listed in the holy writings and in time, there came a man named John who was born of Zechariah who was of the priestly line of Zadok. And thus it behooved John the Baptist to fulfill all righteousness when he baptized the lamb of God in the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized, and came straight out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to him, and John saw the Spirit of God

descending like a dove, and lighting upon him. And lo, a voice came from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And thus as Jesus the Nazarene ordained a priest forevermore after the Order of Melchizedek and all offices have been restored under the mantle of this eternal priesthood, both now and forevermore.
Because the Order of Melchizedek is a priestly order, of which mantle will not pass from Yeshua HaMashiach, because he is risen to die no more!
Because the Order of Melchizedek is an order of Kings for the righteous rule of my creation.
Because the Order of Melchizedek is an order for Prophets who speak and teach the history, ways, and future of Yahweh’s plans of perfection given in the face of Jesus the Christ.

I AM YHVH, even the Great I AM and I have sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent. Of a truth, to my Messenger and servant who serves under Christ Jesus his eternal Lord by way of the spirit of prophecy has Yahweh and Christ Jesus revealed to our messenger and servant The Everlasting Gospel for the obedience and salvation of all these Words are sent. And the Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes ears, and hearts of all to whom they are sent.
I AM YHVH, even he who has created, made and sent my only begotten Son, Yeshua HaMashiach who is Jesus the Messiah for the salvation of all who are born of Adam and accept full redemption should those who are called answer their savior when he calls. Therefore, understand that it is I, YHVH, the Great I AM who reveals Jesus the Nazarene to the lost, even so that their Chief Shepherd may find and recover all of my lost sheep into my barns of safety and refuge eternally and forevermore.
I AM YHVH, even he who divided the eternal priesthood of Melchizedek into three separate and distinct offices of King, Priest, and Prophet under Jacob in his times.
I AM YHVH, even he who has restored the eternal Priesthood of Melchizedek in Christ Jesus, of whom it is written: For it is evident, that your Lord sprung out of Judah, concerning the which tribe Moses spake nothing, touching the Priesthood. And it is yet a more evident thing, because that after the similitude of Melchizedek, there is risen up another Priest, which is not made priest after the Law of the carnal commandment of old, but after the power of the endless life. For he testifies thus, You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.

For the commandment that went before, is disanulled, because of the weakness thereof, and unprofitableness.
For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope made perfect, whereby we draw near to Yahweh. And for as much as it is not without an oath (for these are made Priests without an oath: But this is made with an oath by him that said to him, Yahweh has sworn, and will not repent, You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek) By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better Testament. And among them many were made Priests, because they could not continue, by the reason of their death.

But this man, because he continues forever, has a Priesthood, which cannot pass from one to another. Wherefore, he is able also perfectly to save them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives, to make intercession for them.
Therefore, I give you to understand The Eternal Order of Melchizedek and the truth of Yeshua HaMashiach, who is also Jesus the Christ because under his eternal Mantle of High priest after The Order of Melchizedek will Christ Jesus coronate and consecrate a mighty host of kings and priests under The Order of Melchizedek and thereby will the Kingdom of Heaven be ruled by the eternal hand of their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, under whom they will perfectly in righteousness and true holiness rule forevermore, because of Christ Jesus Kingdom, there is never an end.

Two Horns of a Lamb.
JANUARY 09, 2025
Behold, I come to show you secrets of these end times that have come upon the earth before Jacob's trouble breaks fully across the earth. So bow your ears in humility to hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach so that you may understand the times you live, even times where great deception abounds. Yet, so are the times you live and so are the times of judgment that have come upon the entire world. Behold! Hear the Words of Christ Jesus my loves, and hear my Words that I am sending to comfort your hearts and to give you understanding of many things you now see that are overtaking the earth, and so that you may always follow my eternal commandment of fear not! Because of an eternal truth, the calamities that have come on the world and the judgments that are set for the unrighteous, and the scoffers, and those who refuse Yahweh’s peace treaty are not intended for the righteous and for the faithful and for those who have accepted Yahweh’s peace treaty for so it is written and so shall it be done.
Therefore, my loves, allow me to comfort you in times of distress that you may have to give to him that is in need and that you might love Yahweh with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and that you may love your neighbor even as you love yourselves, because truly, truly, all who live in such manner do show the ways of Yahweh that you have learned of me, your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, for so I am! So I ask you to circumcise your hearts in obedience and accept my Words of truth that are also Words of comfort so that you may have peace in times of calamity, even a time when the birth pangs will culminate with the faithful in Christ being recreated and born again fully into the Heavens and fashioned after Christ Jesus who is the last Adam.
And of an eternal truth the times have come for full redemption and the full redemption and salvation of the faithful in Christ is set to occur suddenly and unexpectedly now, and the day, time, and hour is now known in the heavens, and the host of heaven stands at the ready as they await that mighty shout, as they await the sounding of the last trumpet because the trumpet has been given and the times are now. Even a moment in time where promised redemption and complete salvation are realized in the twinkling of an eye in wondrous perfection and there will be no more delay. Even a moment in time of full consummation where all the faithful in Christ during my times of grace starting on the day of Pentecost all these jubilees ago, when Yahweh gave to me that holy spirit of sonship that I did pour out on them as they were all with one accord in one place. When suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing and mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they sat. And there appeared to them cloven tongues, like fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with holy spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance. And so my babes in Christ who were newly born again were endowed with perfect speech in languages they themselves did not understand as they spoke in great boldness the wondrous works of Yahweh!
And so was the birth of my Church and so are the promises concerning it, that truly, truly, the gates of hell will not prevail against my true Church and truly never will! Although many will fall away in faithless insincerity that emanated from their own faithless hearts as they confessed Jesus as Lord in faithless unbelief, even refusing to believe that I have indeed been raised from the dead! Even a confession of Jesus as Lord, where they never repented of sin nor changed their evil ways, but instead chose the blindness

brought about by Jesuit fables that have corrupted Christianity into denominational sects, and of an eternal truth Christ is never divided, and Yahweh is never mocked! Therefore, understand that the spirit of sonship is withheld from those who approach Jesus the Nazarene with insincere and faithless confessions. And so I ask, how can a confession of saving faith come from lips that are connected to faithless hearts? Yet, so is the tragedy of your times that natural man has a choice to receive full redemption and full remission of sins and refuses instead, choosing evil and their own eternal judgment. And this because most natural men, even men who have not my holy spirit of sonship, refuse to accept that they are in a sinful and corrupted state, and therefore stand in haughty arrogance claiming their own useless works are righteous instead, even claims that will not stand in the judgments to come, nor that are acceptable in my sight because no man may come to Yahweh, The Great I AM, except through me, Jesus the Nazarene!
Judgment falls! Judgment falls! Judgment falls! Behold! Judgment falls on Secret Babylon, even as promised, even because my many warnings were ignored, even because my Words sent by my messengers and prophets for the salvation of those who have now chosen judgment and their own destruction in disobedient rebellion were tossed aside like worthless refuse. Thus was it written, and so it is coming to pass: And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
And so it is coming to pass that judgment falls on Secret Babylon, and her pleasures are taken from her in judgment. And shortly now it will fully come to pass as it has been written by John the Revelator who faithfully recorded the Words given by my hand: For in one hour so great riches are come to desolation. Therefore, riches and pleasures are being taken from the earth and will not return until my millennial kingdom has come and this is done in judgment and punishment on those who lusted after these delicacies with the intent that they may come to repentance should they turn with full faith in their hearts to Jesus the Nazarene by calling on my name at the expense of their own lives to obtain salvation from a judged and dying world that truly, truly will come to utter destruction and judgment and none shall escape except through the grace and mercy of Yahweh given in the face of Christ Jesus the resurrected and ascended King of Righteousness!
Yet, Yahweh is faithful because he did bind himself in covenant with Noah that he would never destroy the earth suddenly with a flood anymore, but that the earth would be taken by fire in final judgment that is set to fall fully starting with the house of God. Because even in these times of final judgment, grace and mercy and salvation will be obtained by a multitude of multitudes who will see the error of their ways and who will call on the name of Jesus for their salvation and of Israel who will accept Yeshua HaMashiach as their true Messiah and many will be given entrance into my millennial kingdom wherein only righteousness will be found. Because I am The King of Righteousness and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war!
Therefore, understand that Yahweh is an all consuming fire, and I am Christ Jesus who sits with billow in hand stoking the flames of purification so that the treasures of Yahweh (which is his people) can be purified of all dross that they may stand before their eternal Lord and Savior clothed not in their own futile works of unrighteousness, but will stand instead before me clothed in fine white, spotless linen because they accepted the righteousness given by my own hand in the New Testament that I will use to rule the earth in righteousness, even a Testament of perfection that will never cease. And of those who accept salvation

in this manner it will be said of them that truly they did not love their lives to the end and instead will have chosen to depart from this evil world in the honors or martyrdom, even in whose honors I sacrificed myself as the lamb of God even so that all who chose Jesus the Christ as their savior might live eternally in perfection before Yahweh the Great I AM! Therefore, understand that the servant is not greater than his master.
And so it is that judgment begins at the house of God and Jacob’s trouble is set to break across the earth fully, so soon as the faithful in Christ are gathered, and then the seals will be loosed, and the trumpets will blow and the wrath of the Lamb will fall fully on the earth because The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof in righteous obedience to the will and eternal plan of salvation given by Yahweh in the Mystery of God for those of Adam who will accept righteous salvation and for judgment of sinners who will be removed from the face of the earth in the righteous judgments to come.
For of a truth had the princes of this world understood the Mystery of God that I revealed to the apostle Paul when I taught him, and he did write accurately for obedience to righteousness for all who are sanctified thereby: that the princes of this world never would have crucified the Lord of glory had they understood The Mystery of God. Because by giving myself innocently into their hateful hands, in their brutish hate did they unwittingly sacrifice the lamb of God who is the innocent blood! Thereby redeeming Adam fully for all those who choose to call on my name for their salvation, thus escaping eternal corruption in the blood of Adam brought about by the serpent in the Garden of Eden all this time ago. Yet so it is, that the Satans in their hateful and ignorant lusts helped bring about the salvation of Adam whom they seek to destroy from the face of the earth! Except they were defeated fully by their own actions in their ignorance of Yahweh’s eternal wisdom, even The Great I AM, who they sought to overcome by craft, even an impossibility that will never occur because Yahweh overtakes the crafty in eternal judgment that they will never escape.
Wherefore, understand that I am he who stokes the flames of purification that all who would come to Yahweh in the face of Jesus Christ may fully find salvation and may fully come to me to be recreated fully in their proper times and order. And so it is that the time has come to gather the faithful in Christ, even the first-fruits from the dead, even that great barley harvest that is about to happen so suddenly now because the times of harvest have come to Yahweh’s garden of grace where a mighty and righteous harvest will be gathered in the storehouses of Yahweh and the chaff will be bound and burned eternally forevermore in unquenchable fires of punishment, so declares The Lord of Harvest!
Even though, at the time of this writing the great gathering of the faithful in Christ has not occurred and many of my faithful struggle to not lose hope in their Lord’s imminent appearing by impatience and many temptations. Therefore, I, Christ Jesus, do give you to understand that the gathering of the faithful in Christ is already in motion and cannot be stopped nor delayed, and so understand that what has been declared and set in motion in the throne and power of Yahweh cannot be changed, nor altered in the least and will come to pass exactly as foretold and at the exact perfect time chosen by Yahweh himself, because whatever it is that Yahweh sets to purpose will come to pass in complete perfection for so is the glory of Yahweh, The Great I AM!

Come out from among them and be separate, and so I warn you again because it is time to depart from the cares of this evil world because your departure is at hand. I counsel you to live your remaining, fleeting time in righteousness so that you may be at the ready for your Lord’s voice so that I may command you in service to your neighbor that you are to love, even in the same manner that you love yourselves that you may sow seeds of righteousness in their hearts and bring the stragglers to the Ark before that great open door in the heavens slams shut in judgment. I counsel you to live the time remaining in righteousness so that you may be ready for the voice of your Lord and so that you might hear that mighty shout when the final trumpet blows to gather the faithful in Christ. And my appearing will be seen and known worldwide because as the lightning comes out of the east, and is seen into the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Yet so will it be when I revealed myself to Paul on the road to Damascus that those who are accepted into the heavens will hear the trumpet and understand its sound and many will see my glory break across the skies. Yet, most will not be able to distinguish that mighty shout and not understand the utterance given thereby, and so they will remain.
So I give you to understand that at the time of my appearing the brightness of my glory will fill the heavens and my glory will be seen and the world will know and understand for a moment that Christ Jesus has made his appearing because the faithful in Christ will be suddenly taken into the safety of the heavens where they will stand before their Lord, even recreated in eternal righteousness forevermore! And those left behind who were so sure they would be accepted at my appearing will weep, howl, and fall into great and bitter distress. Even so, as the gravity of their situation and future settles on them. Then many of them will fully commit themselves to call on my name no matter what and to call on my name to the end, and they will be resurrected into indescribable glory because the weight of their eternal reward is not worthy to compare to the sufferings experienced in this evil world, so says your eternal Lord who willingly hung on a stake for your salvation.
Even so, I will inspire an unbreakable resolve within them to endure the trials and testings that will have come fully on the earth, even trials and testings that are still currently restrained and sealed. Yet, they will do many might works of service and love for their fellow man in these times and I will give many mighty miracles for their salvation and many will endure the trials and honors of martyrdom in these times, thereby obtaining an eternally significant inheritance and reward that has not entered fully into the hearts of men at this time. And so I tell all who will read these Words of The Everlasting Gospel to look not to the left nor to the right but keep your focus on Jesus the Christ who will strengthen you to endure so that many more may come to salvation from your example and witness.
Nevertheless, so will it be that the beast from the sea, the beast from the earth who is also the false prophet will all rise in their time, even when they are released by the restrainer to do what is given for them to accomplish in the short time that they will be, and never will they rise again in such fashion. And in great deception will he literally claim to rise from the dead, because the beast from the earth will surely fake his own head-wound and great calamity will ensue as a result, even as foretold previously by Yahweh in A Lamb With Two Horns. Understand that they will hide themselves away during their calamitous war that they are waging currently that will be fully loosed when the restrainer is removed and their war will be fulfilled with all the destruction that their war will bring. Because out of utter chaos will their new order rise and the beast from the earth will lie and claim that he is risen from the dead for the salvation of Israel and to cleanse the world of evil, even an evil that they themselves will fully bring.

Yet so I give you to understand the deception that these evil beasts bring so that you are not ensnared thereby. Wherefore, understand that the fallen ones breed humans as a rancher breeds cattle. They mix and match and make their abominations and they claim they are gods on account of mixing seed that should never mix, because Yahweh created life after it’s kind and always has it been intended that Yahweh made the beast of the earth according to his kind, and the cattle according to his kind to preserve the purity and glory of each creature that Yahweh has created in his righteous love for his creations. Yet, the fallen ones sin against all forms of Yahweh’s creation as they seek to mix, match, and clone species against species, even so they may pretend they are gods, when all they are are pretenders who pretend.
Therefore, understand that the fallen ones are those who seek to mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another, just as iron and clay is not mixed with clay. Understand that the fallen ones have developed many lying technologies and tricks to control and deceive those who dwell on the earth, and even all who have pleasure in unrighteousness. Understand that they have developed many abominations made for the destruction of natural man from the face of the earth. Understand that the watchers have once again made their abominations, and understand that the fallen ones have learned to copy and clone life that has been breathed into the nostrils of mankind because mankind was created in the image of Yahweh.
Therefore, understand that any abomination made by the fallen ones is not made in the image of Yahweh but is an imitation of life, and is not made fully from the kind of Adam and therefore, cannot be redeemed neither achieve salvation and is intended for the complete and total destruction of Adam and all abominations that are made in like manner are bound to fulfill the lusts of their Fathers that they will surely do. That which is crooked cannot be made straight and they will have neither root nor branch and they will all goto eternal judgment for the evils they have committed.
Understand further that the beast from the earth does come to rule with his venom in hand, even that eternal snakebite that is also the mark of the beast. Understand that anyone one from Adam, male or female, who willingly takes the mark of the beast will be forevermore altered from the image of Yahweh forevermore, and will be slaves bound to the will of the hive mind because their minds will be linked to the internet of things to be, even an internet made for demons and fallen angels to possess and control. What? You thought their technologies were for the benefit of man and that mankind developed these technologies by tinkering around in a garage? Repudiate their lies my loves and do not fall victim to their senseless fables.
So it will be that all who take their mark will be meshed with their technologies and will become nodes in their network and will be controlled by their technologies and frequencies and they will be the walking damned who can never attain salvation in their altered state and all who join themselves to their technologies and alterations are forever bound to their judgments, never to depart, and they will have their portion in the fallen ones inheritance of burning brimstone for all eternity.
Nevertheless, the fallen ones continue in their insanity and madness as they seek to escape the firmament under which they are bound for judgment. They continue to make their abominations and they have many technologies of which natural man is not yet aware. And as in the days of old natural man will continue to worship the fallen ones on account of their so called technologies and manipulations. Many of their abominations are made even as in the days of Noah by fornication between the fallen angels and women

taken from the children of men. Many of the fallen ones already walk openly among the children of men in disguise of their true selves, and many more appear fully human but are hybrids between angels and men, just as it was in the days of Noah. Behold! I bring giants to fulfill my wrath!
So I give you to understand their many of their deceptions will cause fire to fall from the sky in the sight of men, even where they already cause much destruction and they will continue to develop and reveal their technologies even so that the beast from the earth who is also their false Moshiach will cause fire to fall from the heavens in the sight of men, even a cheap counterfeit devised to appear powerful against my two witnesses who will shortly rise in their times of prophecy and power. Because my two witnesses who are my two candlesticks, who are my two olive trees will cause fire to fall from heaven at their command, and just as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses and Aaron, so to will the beast and false prophet withstand my two Olive trees seeking to counterfeit the true power of Yahweh, The Great I AM!
Nevertheless, the beast from the earth is an alternating copy of himself, except in his deception he appears that he is one, but in reality he is two of which you will not see both at the same time. Because a twin it is not but an abominable copy of himself. Therefore, understand the duality of their occultic beliefs to understand their methods and insane ways of which they seek to overcome you my loves, and remain firm and fixed with your eyes on Jesus the Nazarene, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach because I have overcome them already. Therefore, stand fast and you will fully overcome their evil schemes that come to nothing. So understand the dual nature of the lamb with two horns who speaks like the dragon because he brings a two state solution to rule the earth with the beast from the sea, and he will make an image of himself in similar fashion as Nebuchadnezzar, and of himself there is not one but two that the dragon will use to deceive the world with his lying signs and wonders. Except, a golden image he will not make but an image used for lying signs and wonders made of their worthless technologies that are so soon to be made an eternal end.
Yet so are the nature of their deceptions because they have no heavenly power any longer because in their defilement they have been stripped of all honor and all authority and no longer are they endowed with the power of Yahweh, but go about in their own strength and hatefully manipulate the creation in their worthless mysteries to seem as gods to natural man who runs after them in his lusts for their technologies and seemingly powerful ways and false occultic systems of death that will lead all who partake to those hottest flames of blue in that great lake of fire where the flames of punishment ever burn the hottest purity.
And so is the nature of their deception that they should set themselves as if they are gods, when in reality they are pretenders who pretend. And in their lying signs and wonders what will cause the world to wonder after them, saying who is like the beast? Except in reality they will be fully deceived and captured by the dragon’s worthless lying signs and wonders and through many deceptions will they deceive the unrighteous who will follow them eternally, bound to them forevermore. Because the skies under the firmament are now filled with the fallen ones themselves, and their technologies, and even with holographic images they will display to cover my appearing that will happen so unexpectedly now.
They will use their technologies to keep natural man chained to his coming judgment and destruction and the majority of those who dwell on the earth in unrighteousness will follow their ways, never to return and persecute my beloved doves again, because they will be forevermore cast to the flames. Therefore, I give you to understand the fullness of their deception that they will cause lying signs and wonders by their hidden technologies that are mere manipulations of the glory of Yahweh’s creation that is reserved

for the inheritance of the meek. They will use their CGI technologies to make their images so lifelike that those who are bound to stare at their mirrors by way of the mark of the beast will utterly live a false reality, very similar to the false reality brought about by the mystery of iniquity currently where people go from screen to screen, even holding the digital chains of their bondage happily in hand as they are inundated with useless knowledge that utterly results in arrogant delusion, even separated from reality for all eternity should the not repent!
Their AI will rise fully, and is nothing more than demons working through their technologies, even built by the hands of the children of men. Yet, artificial intelligence it is not, but a vehicle for disembodied spirits to thrive, and a means of control and deception wherewith to make it appear that their lying signs and wonders are divine power given to support their lies.

I am Christ Jesus and I do come to tell you of these deceptions even that you are not ensnared thereby.
I am Christ Jesus and I am he, who along with Yahweh, has revealed and sent these Words to our messenger and servant and by our messenger and servant have these words been revealed and sent. Truly, truly, these Words are part of The Everlasting Gospel that has been revealed in it’s time, and the Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of all to whom they are sent.
I am Jesus the Christ who is sent for the salvation of Adam, who truly truly is the last Adam, even that last kind of man to be made and truly, truly, I will change the faithful in Christ at my appearing (whether they be living or dead) to be fashioned in like manner as my glorified body. Because Adam was created with the intent that he would rule according to The Order of Melchizedek that has been preserved for Christ Jesus for all times even so that I may coronate and consecrate a host of Kings and Priests to rule along with me, even under my mighty and perfect command.
I am he whom Yahweh, The Great I AM, has sworn forever and will not repent, that I am forever and forevermore, High Priest after The Order of Melchizedek and from my eternal shoulders the mantle of Melchizedek will never pass but will rest on Christ Jesus forevermore.
I am The Lion of the Tribe of Judah and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war.

So understand the times you live my loves, and stand firm wherever it is that you stand, and in whatever courses I have set your feet to run, because the hour of your redemption has come and will break across the earth so suddenly and unexpectedly now. And yet I send this message not only for my Church, my Body, and even my Bride but also to Jacob, even Israel my kinsman of who I am kinsman redeemer, of whom I will save alive to myself a mighty remnant! Because my two olive trees represent the natural olive tree, and also the wild olive tree from which the gentiles were grafted into the root and fatness of the natural olive tree. Even so that Yahweh would be able to save the lost tribes of the house of Israel eternally and forevermore into the Israel of God, thereby being adopted as Sons of God, and also being eternally grafted into the natural olive tree, and of the two there shall eternally remain one! Even the Israel of God!
Therefore, understand that in like fashion as my two olive trees will become one by grafting in the wild branches to partake of the root and fatness of the of the natural olive tree. And so too will those redeemed

from Adam become one new man, even a new creation fashioned after their eternal Lord and savior, even by way of the redeemed from Adam being recreated into one new man. And in similar fashion that the branches of the wild olive tree were grafted in to partake of the root and fatness of the natural olive tree, so too will those I have redeemed from Adam be grafted into the Israel of God and will partake of the root and fatness of their eternal inheritance that they will gain from the eternal olive tree, even Christ Jesus, because through Christ have you all been made full partakers of the goodness and fatness of the root, wherein does all true goodness reside, even in Yahweh, The Great I AM! Because you will all be redeemed and eventually the two will become one. And so in time Adam will cease to exist, and all who are ordained to eternal salvation will be made a new creation forevermore and forevermore without corruption, and so will it be done. Selah!

The Two Witnesses and Momentary Closure of Testimony.
JANUARY 13, 2025
From Yahweh, The Great I AM:
Behold! I come to tell you of my two witnesses, my two candlesticks and my two olive trees and to give sight to the blind by revealing secrets that have been kept secret from the world in my wisdom, even so that you may know the surety of things to come and that the path to salvation may be made plain to all who read and have faith to obey these Words of The Everlasting Gospel.
Behold! I AM Yahweh, even he who created the heavens and the earth for my eternal purposes and glory, and I AM he who will restore the creation from corruption, even so that the righteous ways of Yahweh are soon to fill the earth in righteousness in the face of Jesus Christ. And so my ways will saturate the earth in Christ Jesus Millennial Kingdom, even a Kingdom where no evil thing shall enter, even a Kingdom where the earth is ruled in righteousness, and true peace and restitution will fill the earth, and the faithful of all generations will walk therein in perfect peace and tranquility because the ways of Yahweh will cover the earth in righteousness. Even a time when Satan is bound in torment and utter fear and horror of his coming inheritance of eternal punishment, where he will witness the beast and false prophet cast to the flames of eternal punishment and burned, because so are they all worthy, and yet he will fulfill my eternal purposes of righteousness before he is bound and cast to the fires forevermore never to depart, and I will set the seal and never again will they come to mind.
And I will give (and enjoy) a Sabbath days rest with my righteous overcomers and all who are allowed entrance in to Christ Jesus Millennial Kingdom! (Because a thousand years is as a day in my sight and a day as a thousand years and a thousand years is a millennium.) Even all those who will have been gathered and resurrected from all generations, present and past, in Christ Jesus; even before Satan is cast to the flames, before his little season of finality comes to pass. At the conclusion of which that old serpent will be eternally bound and cast to the fires, never to depart from his unending punishment in the hottest flames of burning brimstone. Because Satan and all who follow his lies are truly powerless in my eternal sight! Who is it that can overcome Yahweh, the Great I AM, though they lie and boast? Or who can alter my eternal will and declarations of judgments that are set to fall fully when my restrainer is removed so suddenly now at the sound of the trumpet blast that has been given to sound at the exact and perfect time that I have chosen in my eternal plan from eternities past. Even a moment in time that is so soon to come to pass where righteous promise meets eternal fulfillment in the times of now.
Because I AM, The Great I AM, even he who knows the end from the beginning and the beginning from the end. Therefore, I do come to reveal aspects of my eternal plan of salvation that has remained a mystery, even things still concealed in The Mystery of God that is soon to conclude in eternal righteousness. Even as it was written by John the Revelator as he faithfully recorded the Words given him by Christ Jesus! And so it is written that in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall begin to blow the trumpet, even the mystery of God shall be finished, as he has declared to his servants the Prophets.
Yet, so many have been blinded to the truth of these Words by lying dispensational wizards who were paid by the red shield to distort my holy writings with dispensational and Zionist lies and lying replacement

theologies, even lies given in craft by the fallen ones through evil men to deceive the hearts of the meek and lowly. And they will deceive my very elect should my elect chose to ignore my Words of righteousness in arrogance thinking they can never be deceived on account of their election. Yet all who err in such fashion by refusing truth in favor of their lies will be deceived. Therefore, understand my people that the seventh trumpet is not the same trumpet given to sound to end my times of grace and gather the faithful in Christ, so be not deceived!
Nevertheless, the truth of Yahweh stands eternally sure and is unalterable, and my Word cannot be broken, and my Word will accomplish that which I intend to whomever my Word is sent. Neither is there anyone who can stop my eternal plans! Neither is there anyone who can stop Christ Jesus, in whom my eternal plan of salvation rests in full. Even he whom I have empowered above every creature in my creation and given full rule over my creation until his enemies be made his footstool, at which time he will present the subjected Kingdom to Adonai Yahweh.
Yet of an eternal truth, there is never an end of the righteous rule of Yeshua HaMashiach, who will rule in righteousness for all eternity, even with his bride who will continue with him forevermore and for all eternity in their offices of authority and orders of service. And that because they received Jesus the Nazarene as their eternal Lord in the times of grace and mercy, and they loved him fully in obedience to his Words, even by which Words they will have fully overcome all things of the enemies’ kingdom forevermore.
Because of an eternal truth, the mantle of Melchizedek rests firmly on Yeshua HaMashiach’s eternal shoulders, never to depart! Because forevermore and for all eternity will The King of Righteousness rule forevermore with his order of Priests, Kings, and Prophets who will fill the earth with the righteous ways and knowledge of Yahweh, even into the times when prophecies shall cease forevermore because I will make my abode with men in the new heaven and new earth that is soon to be created in righteousness and true holiness! Even a creation where the knowledge of good and evil will cease eternally more and only righteousness and love and peace will be found forevermore never to depart nor to be diluted or lessened or corrupted in the least. Even so because corruption will be cast to the flames forevermore.
Yet, so it is that the fallen ones have covered and spread their lies over my creation even broadcasting them non-stop over their infernal technologies, even so that that natural man may be controlled and manipulated by their frequencies and infernal technologies. Even mind controlling and behavior modifying images, evil narratives, and spells that are broadcast on their black mirrors where many sit in darkness hypnotized by their images and lies. And of a truth, the fallen ones have enchanted the masses with poisons and pharmakeia passed as medicine, even so they are poisoned and culled thereby. Yet, their poisons and technologies and mirrors will be destroyed forevermore, and their broadcasts will cease eternally, by which they cast their spells and excite the passions and lusts of natural man in great sin and their worthless technologies will come to nothing, never to be again.
Yet, so it is, that I allowed the fallen ones to cover my creation in their lies, even so that all who would follow their disgusting ways may choose to remain in their eternal inheritance of burning brimstone because they had pleasure in unrighteousness by sinning against Yahweh, the Great I AM, and against the innocent in my creation, whom they have wronged. And in my eternal wisdom and love for my creation, I have allowed each from Adam to choose who they will serve: whether sin unto death, or obedience to righteousness unto eternal life.

So are the ways of Yahweh, because my ways are ways of righteousness, peace and love! Even eternal and unending love, where my entire creation, composed of a host of various and wonderfully made creations of all sorts and purposes, will live in righteous harmony and love. Because my creation is intended as an interrelated tapestry of life governed in righteousness and love for the full benefit and glory of every one of my creations, where not one being will ever benefit at the expense and loss of another, but all will share freely of the unending bounty contained in my storehouses intended for the benefit and glory of those who obey my righteous commandments from their hearts in love to their eternal Father, of which truly, I AM!
Yet, so it is, that I AM The Great I AM and I do not endorse nor agree with their lies, neither will I allow their lies to continue. So it is, that I do declare, that I, Yahweh, The Great I AM who is The Everlasting God of Righteousness will expose fully every aspect of the enemies’ kingdom that is set to rise for the very short season the dragon is given rule, and a very limited rule will he have. And likewise, I will expose the fallen ones who have hidden themselves amongst my creation, who are to be rooted out and exposed in their eternal shame fully before they are cast to the flames of punishment forevermore, where their worm dies not. And so my declaration will go forth, because what has been declared in the glory and power of the throne of Yahweh, even The Great I AM, can never be altered nor changed, and will come to pass exactly as declared. Selah!
Yet, so it is, that I have never concealed the fallen ones fully, and I have already begun their full exposure and the veil is thinning. Even that veil of concealment wherewith I have hidden them away from mankind’s sight, and the restrainer will be removed that is composed of various points of restraint that will be removed fully when Michael is given command when the final trumpet sounds so suddenly now. And so will the ice fall, and the earth will be altered, and they will have their great war and many will perish thereby, even as written and foretold by John the Revelator in his eternal testimony. And so I give you to understand that at the time of the gathering together of the faithful in Christ that I will remove that veil of partial concealment just as suddenly and forcefully as I tore the veil of the temple in two from top to bottom which marked the end of Levi’s service and the full restoration of Melchizedek. Even so that I may remove partial blindness from the children of Israel forevermore, never again to return to my doves.
And this will happen suddenly and unexpectedly because the world does not expect Christ Jesus to lighten the horizons and skies fully with his eternal glory in these times of culminating birth pains, even so, because the world truly is faithless. And of those who are refused entry into the heavens when that great door shuts, many who are vile sinners will perish and be taken in judgment for all eternity, even those who have rejected Jesus the Nazarene fully in great blasphemy and pride against my holy bow, and many others who are just as sinful in their rebellious refusal will fall eternally to harsh judgment on account of the evils they have committed. Even the same evils they continue in great commitment to commit, and they will not escape.
Understand that all who seek to violate the natural boundaries and orders of my creation by crossing those boundaries and orders, even seeking to transition themselves into abominations (in the ways of the fallen ones) will also likewise fall to eternal judgment just the same: Because this is the unforgivable sin, even blasphemy against Yahweh who is The Holy Spirit, seeking to change themselves from the image of Yahweh that they were initially created. Therefore, repudiate their Jesuit fables that have altered the true godhead into fables brought about by Nimrod with his original unholy three! Because the holy three of Father, Son,

THE

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

and holy spirit has been corrupted from its original meaning and intent, yet the truth of Yahweh can never be hidden by the weak and beggarly elements thought they do lie! Nevertheless, Jesus the Nazarene is Yahweh manifest in the flesh, and my holy spirit of sonship does fill fully the faithful in Christ who truly will are part of the godhead in their rule with Christ Jesus under The Order of Melchizedek as Priests and Kings forevermore! Therefore, understand who you are in Christ my children because the fallen ones seek to hide the truth concerning you by their spurious fables.
Yet, the faithful in Christ have lived and died and still walk the face of the earth in great faith, and this wonderful and glorious moment will not overtake them in ignorance because they will understand the utterance of that great shout, and they will understand the voice of the last trumpet that has already been given in hand with full orders to sound when the command is given by Christ Jesus, who always perfectly does the will of Adonai Yahweh. The faithful in Christ will be allowed entrance into that great door into the heavens that no person on earth may shut nor open, whether they are asleep or alive on the face of the earth at the time of their call!
And great distress will overtake the unfaithful who confessed Jesus the Nazarene from a faithless heart, even refusing to live lives of repentance because they loved their sins. It will come to pass that those who did choose to continue in sin, who by disobedient and stubborn hearts confessed Jesus as Lord but continued in the works of the flesh will be left to the refiners fire for the destruction of the flesh, even so that they may escape the pleasures of sin and that they may escape their flesh that has captivated them in the lusts thereof. And many will come to salvation by calling on Jesus the Nazarene until their last breath, because it has always been a requirement for the faithful, that a man be found faithful to his last breath, should he not be one of the relative few who are taken alive into the safety of the heavens in their times of faithfulness. Selah!
And their war will rage and continue for its appointed time and out of the ashes of their destruction will they rise. The dragon, the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth who is also their false prophet will rise in great blasphemy to have their cruel but mercifully short rule. Nevertheless, Yahweh, The Great I AM, has never left himself without witness, as witnessed by a host of witnesses in my eternal and holy writings that have been preserved perfectly in the heavens. And as it is, many of my testimonies have been lost to time and neglect by those who were given charge of their care. Understand the ages my children and repudiate their dispensational counterfeit lies. Understand that creation is not millions of years old according to the fallen one’s lies. Creation is just under six thousand years old and I have divided these times into ages. There was an age of relative chaos thanks to the fallen ones who polluted the world that then was with their abominations, even which abominations were destroyed fully in judgment culminating in the great deluge in the days of Noah.
Yet, Noah continued alive through the flood, even saved alive on the Ark with his posterity (and the animals and creations) that were given space to continue because Noah was was a righteous man and a righteous ruler after The Order of Melchizedek, on whose shoulders the mantle rested until my servant went to his peaceful rest until he is awakened so soon now in righteousness. In time Moses was drawn alive from the waters of the Nile, and he did rise in great might and he did usher in my age of Torah, even when Israel was made a great and mighty nation which was a shadow of things to come.

And at the perfect and exact appointed time Jesus the Nazarene was born of a virgin and did rise to become the lamb of God, even sacrificing himself in eternal atonement for the penalty of Moses, even a sacrifice that I accepted for all eternity for the remission of sins forevermore, for all that are sanctified thereby, even in his New Testament of righteousness that Christ Jesus ratified and sealed forevermore in his own sinless blood, therefore, there is no more need for animal sacrifice. Truly, Jesus the Nazarene is the fulcrum of righteousness for all time, even a point in time that culminated with the defeat of the fallen ones forevermore, even a point in time captured with the eternal Words “IT IS FINISHED!”
And so my age of grace was ushered in on that day of Pentecost when I gave Christ Jesus my holy spirit of Sonship that he did pour out at my commandment for the redemption of all who chose to become sons of God given by the spirit of Sonship during these times. And so was the birth of Christ Jesus’ Church that was given for grace and mercy on the gentiles, even before harsh and final judgment falls. Even times of mercy and grace where the lost tribes of the house of Israel could be gathered into the Israel of God, along with anyone from the nations who were called and responded by making Jesus the Nazarene their eternal Lord. And my people who were scattered in chastisement and who wandered the earth as pilgrims in strange lands, and all from Adam who accepted salvation in these times will forevermore be part of The Israel of God, never to depart from their eternal orders of service to Christ Jesus their ascended Lord!
So understand that the world that is now has come to its eternal end and this present evil world will never again exist to trouble those I love forevermore. And so my age of grace continues up until the final second where that final trumpet of the age of grace sounds that has already been given to blow. At the conclusion of Jacob's trouble, which is also Daniels seventieth week, even a week of years where each day is a year in a week of seven days will Yeshua HaMashiach’s Millennial Kingdom be established for a day of rest at the conclusion of which will be seven thousand years. Wherefore, understand that there will have been three ages of two thousand years each, with a sabbath day of a thousand years that will come to pass in holy and righteous conclusion where my creation is fully redeemed from sin, never to sin again.
So understand the times you live, because the mysteries and ways of Yahweh has been lost in part by the sins of men to those who dwell on the earth, hidden even by the deceptions of the fallen ones. The calendar that I gave to Enoch the scribe wherewith mankind was to determine accurately the days, times, and seasons has been largely lost to neglect and rebellion. The history of mankind has been altered in neglect and spurious fables. The holy writings of old have been partially lost on earth to time and sin, and truly I did allow this to happen on account of the sins of my people that they should walk in darkness should they lose track of my holy writings until their repentance from these evils. Nevertheless, my Word can never be broken and it has been preserved literally Word for Word in the heavens, even with the intention that as it is in heaven so shall it be on earth! Selah!
Therefore, I, Yahweh, The Great I AM, do declare and announce the rise of my two witnesses, even men of old taken from among men in their times and they have been preserved alive by my mighty hand. Even so, because Yahweh, The Great I AM has NEVER left himself without witness, and I will yet provide myself perfect witness even in these times of trouble that are so shortly now set to engulf the earth in the flames of judgment. Because my two witnesses are my two candlesticks, and my two olive trees. Thus says the Adonai Yahweh, Behold, I will take the tree of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him even with the tree of Judah, and make them one tree, and they shall be one in mine hand.

Behold! They are witnesses of times forgotten that have been historically altered by the hands of lying scribes who altered the holy writings a little at a time to their own eternal judgment and who removed holy books from their various and sundry canons.
Behold! They are my two candlesticks who will light the path for those who are ordained to eternal salvation and who will give the light of Yahweh in the face of Yeshua HaMashiach in Israel for forty two months during the first half of Jacob's trouble.
Behold! They are my two olive trees, because my two olive trees represent the natural olive tree of Judah, and also the tree of Ephraim of which olive tree the gentiles were grafted into the root and fatness of the natural olive tree forevermore! Selah.
Behold! I do announce to you just exactly who these two mighty witnesses are, so that their way will be prepared and a path is made straight for their appearing and rise. And so my two witnesses are Enoch the Scribe who was taken into the heavens before the flood, and Elijah the Tishbite, even that mighty prophet of old who was taken into the heavens in sight of Elisha, (his successor and witness) in a chariot of fire. Even so as truly recorded in the holy writings of old.
Behold! Enoch the Scribe has scribed in the heavens the works of men and recorded faithfully and perfectly that which was given his hand to accomplish. And he does bring the writings of old, even the same writings that have been lost by the sins of men. And in his scrip does he bring the lost testaments of old. Therefore, understand all who read these Words that during the times of Moses there were many covenant of old that were superseded and enveloped in Moses Testament of Old. And so during the times of Torah Israel maintained the writings of old, even the same writings that were lost in sin and fractious divisions.
Behold! Elijah the Prophet was my witness in the days of Israel before the northern Kingdom was scattered by the Assyrians in chastisement. And he was a mighty prophet in Israel who withstood the prophets of Baal and even Jezebel, priestess of Baal! Elijah will reveal many things and will witness and prophecy hand in hand with Enoch the Scribe and their testimonies will overlap and reveal so many things that have been lost to sin and time by the sons of men in their times.
They will prophecy and teach many things from The Everlasting Gospel and their testimonies will be thusly added to The Everlasting Gospel that is given in the face of Christ Jesus, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach, even he whose New Testament has saved alive eternally the branches from the wild olive tree and has grafted them into the natural olive tree as the Israel of God. Even the same New Testament of which The Everlasting Gospel is part. Yet so it is, that my two witnesses will reveal many things regarding Christ Jesus whom they have served in the heavens in his ruler-ship and will testify of many things they witnessed in the heavens during my age of grace and their testimonies will be preserved eternally.
Therefore, understand the nature of their message and the things they will reveal, because The Everlasting Gospel builds on The Gospel of Salvation and has been hidden in The Mystery of God in my very own heart that is unsearchable and concealed from mankind until the times of revealing. And all testimonies will be fully revealed in these times of revealing that were initiated by the faithful messengers and prophets of Christ Jesus who made the ways straight for my mighty messenger by whom these Words are revealed. Because they will reveal much for the salvation of Israel and they will break partial blindness from the hearts of the meek who have been ordained for salvation before the foundations of the world to obtain an

eternal inheritance and receive eternal life in Yeshua HaMashiach who is their true Messiah and King!
They will prophecy and teach many topics and they will reveal many things kept secret for many Jubilees now and will re-establish much knowledge that has been lost and they will purify Jacob in his chastisement so that they may call Jacob to full repentance by accepting the New Testament of Yeshua HaMashiach given eternally and forevermore and of which Testament is there never an end. They will explain the full plan of salvation that has been given incrementally and revealed by Yahweh himself, in their corresponding times of revealing. Yet, so it is written of my mighty witnesses by John the Revelator as he began to make their paths plain even in his times.
So understand what will be fulfilled at the days their prophecy ends, when they will be killed by the beast who rises from the abyss, even so they may be recreated in like manner as Christ Jesus and will take their places amongst the Israel of God for all eternity, even a high honor given for their reward and glory for their love for Yahweh, The Great I AM, and Yeshua HaMashiach whom they serve. And so it is written and so will it be done when the spirit of life enters them again after three and a half days as they are taken into the heavens by my mighty hand: And the same hour will there be a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city will fall, and in the earthquake will be slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven. Therefore, understand who this remnant is, because this mighty remnant are in part those who will be taken alive and hidden away in the wilderness in a place I have prepared for them already, and so the 144,000 will come to their rescue led by Christ Jesus and will protect and save them alive and heal their wounds and give them great encouragement that will take them into their Messiah’s coming Millennial Kingdom. Selah.
I AM, Yahweh, The Great I AM, and I AM he who has sent these Words by my mighty messenger and servant and by my mighty messenger and servant have my Words been sent. And of an eternal truth, I AM he, along with Christ Jesus, The Everlasting King and Lord of Righteousness have revealed the Words of The Everlasting Gospel to our mighty messenger who was ordained from the foundations of the world for such a purpose and who has come to salvation from the gentiles in much chastisement and purification in the Israel of God and he will serve Christ Jesus as part of his mighty bride for all eternity as he moves into great glory to fulfill my eternal purposes in Christ Jesus in his assigned order, even rewards of glory reserved for the faithful that have not entered fully into the hearts of men at the time of this writing.
And so this portion of Testimony of The Everlasting Gospel is now closed, and our mighty messenger has finished his course, faithfully as intended and will be taken into the heavens at the sound of that mighty trumpet that is to sound so suddenly now. The Words of The Everlasting Gospel will find the eyes, ears, and hearts to all they are intended and will fill the earth in their time, but will only be sent to heirs of salvation in judgment because The Mystery of God and my holy writings were neglected by the sins of men, therefore, a temporary dearth of scripture will fall on the earth in a famine of truth for those who have rejected my eternal truths, yet they will achieve salvation should they call on the name of Jesus to their end, having not loved their lives to the end!
Therefore, understand the Words of The Everlasting God of Righteousness and my judgments that are set to fall. That now is the time of Jacob's trouble and the times of judgment are now set to fully fall, just as soon as the order is given to blow that beautiful last trumpet, and oh so sweet a sound it will make where my faithful children will hear my invite to come up hither! Selah.

And now fire has already started to fall on the earth, as the beast from the earth causes fire to fall in the sight of men on account of the fallen ones technologies. Because he does possess many technologies given him by the fallen ones that he will use to cause great deception on the earth, even causing the world to wonder after him on account of his lying signs and wonders. Have you never seen a magnifying glass my children? Have you never focused it causing the rays of the sun to intensify into an apex of fire? Therefore, do not wonder after their lies because their deceptions and corresponding judgments are not intended for you, should you come fully out of them so you do not share in their judgments.
Yet, according to the promises of old under the Noahic covenant, I, Yahweh, The Great I AM, did bind myself to never destroy the earth by way of a sudden and fully destructive deluge, but that I would judge the earth incrementally by fire until all unrighteousness is burned thereby. And I have allowed the fires of judgment to fall because now is the time of Secret Babylons full judgment that is already underway. And just as Sodom and Gomorrah will her cities burn across the lands that have been polluted by their sins that are a stench in my nostrils.
Nevertheless, I have allowed time and provision for those the faithful in Christ do intercede so that they may escape sudden destruction that will fall any minute now, even so that they may be saved alive and that they may come to salvation by the refiners fire should they so choose their own salvation. Therefore, come fully out from amongst them and be fully separate from them so that you do not share in their judgments.
Also, understand that the enemies of Secret Babylon have been given her resources and wealth fully, and Secret Babylon is now a looted shell of its former self that has no chance for survival, and never again will this sinful and abominable nation rise, even a nation that was made secretly by the fallen ones that served the unintended purpose of providing a refuge for the persecuted who served Christ Jesus (because even my enemies obey my voice) and for the intended purpose that the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth could rise and be selected for their purposes by the fallen ones in their times.
Truly, many abominations have been created in her lands and many cities, tunnels, and bases are under the earth where they will seek to hide themselves. Nevertheless, there is nowhere they can go to escape the wrath of the Lamb and the wrath of Yahweh that will be unleashed according to the Words given to John the Revelator and many of them will be buried in their caves in judgment and will not escape the flames of punishment for their crimes. Yet, they do burn Secret Babylon as they seek to cover their crimes, but their efforts are futile and I, Yahweh, The Great I AM have recorded and do remember ever detestable act, no matter how seemingly small.
Therefore, understand that the first forty two months of Jacob's trouble are given for the wrath of the Lamb given to be poured first on the disobedient of the house of God, even for the full salvation of those given to the refiners fire, and for those from Israel who will choose Yeshua HaMashiach as their savior and will be saved alive by Christ Jesus and his Order of 144,000 taken from the first fruits of the Israel of God and sealed in the heavens in their foreheads by the seal of The Living God! These will be the seals and trumpets given to be released by the might hand of the lamb of Yahweh, who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals and he will do just that so very soon now.
Then will the full wrath of Yahweh be poured out in full fury from the vials in which the wrath of my indignation is contained. Therefore, will the fallen ones fall into great punishment and misery as the goodness of the earth is taken from them and only stench and disgusting plagues remain. Because they

will never have a golden age, and Christ Jesus will utterly obliterate their Kingdom at his second coming that will conclude Jacob’s trouble and at the end of the first forty two months, in the days when the seventh angel begins to sound, even the Mystery of God should be finished. Selah.
I AM that I AM, therefore tell them The Great I AM is he who has sent these Words and he who has Fathered Yeshua HaMashiach, even he into whose mighty hands have all things been given for the salvation and restoration of my creation for all time and eternally forevermore. Selah.
Now is the time, so stand fast and hide yourselves from the start of judgment that is not intended for the righteous.
Look, listen, the trumpet is about to sound. Are you ready?

Behold! Momentary Closure of Testimony, Convergence, and Separation

Addendum

JANUARY 22, 2025
Behold! I, Yeshua HaMashiach, do come to tell my Church, my body, and even my bride of things that are about to come upon the earth. Even so that you may understand the meaning of things about to occur, and that you are not blinded to their significance. Because, the fallen ones do seek to lead all astray with their delusional lies and the earth you have known is being altered from the earth you once knew and is no longer the same and will continue to be altered from its previous arrangement set in place since the flood of Noah.
Behold! As in the days of Noah, so shall the earth become once again so that full judgment may crash fully on the fallen ones own heads and on the earth itself and a final call to righteousness will now sound across the earth in great judgment and wrath that is set to fall so suddenly now. Therefore, understand the times you live and the significance of events to come. Even events that will be cut short in righteousness, because had the days of Jacob's trouble not been shortened, truly, truly, no flesh would be left alive on the earth and all would be made desolate. For so are the lusts of the fallen ones, that in their greed to steal the earth from mankind they would happily cause all life of the flesh that is in the blood to cease forevermore, because the earth was made for man and man to rule the earth in righteousness. Even so, as it is written: What is man that you are mindful of him? Yet you would crown him with glory and honor and set him over the works of your hands.
Yet, the eternal plans and purposes of Yahweh, The Great I AM will be fully fulfilled by my mighty hand!
Therefore, understand the times and the significance of events that are at hand, even so that you are not ensnared thereby or taken in judgment that is not intended for the faithful in Christ. Understand, that at the sound of the last trumpet that is about to sound, even that last trumpet of my age of grace that has been given into my hands with full command to sound at the appointed time that is nearly upon you in full my loves, that the earth will be fully given into the hands of the dragon in his mercifully short rule.
And this because natural man has willingly accepted the rule given by the ten kings, who rise in great deception from ten families of old, who have ruled the earth in great deception and stealth for the fallen ones since they began to rise at the fall of Babel and its tower in the days of Nimrod. These ten families have waited and watched for the return of their fathers and gods who are no fathers and are no gods, but pretenders who pretend. The fallen ones have given their beasts to rule at the dragons command, who have by stealth and empty promises and great division, subverted the nations so that all world leaders now serve the dragon fully, and those who refuse have been, or will be, assassinated by their hidden hands or will fall fully by their coming war of world conquest.
Yet so is the world you live and the times that have overtaken the earth in great evil and complete deception. Because as it is, the world has now rejected my New Testament of Righteousness that truly, truly was sealed and ratified by my own sinless blood that I offered for the full payment of the penalty of Moses. Even so, that fallen man would have a choice to either accept remission of sins and divine salvation and restoration to Yahweh, the Great I AM, by way of Jesus the Nazarene or fallen man would choose to remain fallen and

459

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
THE
Everlasting Gospel

The LITTLE BOOK of Revelation Chapter 10
The BITTER SWEET

in service to the lusts of the fallen ones, accepting full judgment for every sin and every unrighteous act they have unrighteously committed, no matter how small. Understand that all who choose to remain in service to the fallen ones will join them fully in their punishment in that great lake of fire, even a harsh and severe judgment that was not intended for man, nevertheless all who choose to remain with the fallen ones will likewise join the fallen ones because there is no other choice!
Yet, rejection of my New Testament does not cancel the full force and effect of my New Testament because my New Testament is an eternal covenant and eternal Testament that will remain in effect eternally and forevermore even by full force of the High Priest forever after The Order of Melchizedek, and will survive and remain eternally and forevermore as an Everlasting Covenant of Righteousness for the eternal and perfect and righteous rule of Yahweh's creation. Even a creation of things in heaven, and on earth, and even under the earth and there is nowhere to hide where my righteous rule will not take full effect at the end of Daniel's seventieth week, which is also Jacob's trouble, that has now aligned in full convergence of birth pains and a child will be born!
Even a holy child of righteous first-fruits in the full barley harvest that is to take place in full so suddenly and unexpectedly now, even an eternal time of consummation where the dead in Christ will be birthed from the heart of the earth where they have rested peacefully, and the faithful in Christ who are alive and remain will depart from the face of the earth with them to meet me in the air and so will you all be taken into the heaven of heavens where you will stand before your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness to receive your full inheritance! And I will present you without spot or blemish or stain or wrinkle or any such thing to Yahweh, The Great I AM, who truly has Fathered you all by my spirit of Sonship whereby you have been sealed for this day of redemption!
And you will all take your places in the Israel of God, because whether you were born Judean, or from the lost tribes of Israel, of from the gentiles: in Christ Jesus you will no longer be any of these earthly bloodlines but a new creation, a new man, even recreated fully in full perfection in Christ Jesus and you will marvel at the eternal splendor that you will be clothed. Because those in Christ will be fashioned and formed in the same manner as Christ Jesus and my overcomers will inherit all things in the same manner as I overcame and inherited all things from the hand of Yahweh, the Great I AM, and so is the inheritance of the faithful! Therefore, understand at that sudden twinkling of an eye you will all be freed forevermore from the corrupted blood of Adam, even by the last Adam: whom Yahweh has made a life giving spirit who will recreate you all in like fashion as your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, Selah!
Therefore, I will perform a perfect and complete work in you my loves, even according as your faithful obedience to righteousness has been in my times of grace and mercy. Because grace and mercy are setting as the sun in this twilight of convergence, here at the start of Jacob's trouble. Because the convergence I speak is a convergence of righteousness, culminating with the faithful in Christ being fully separated from those who dwell on the earth in unrighteousness, as they are taken into the safety of the heavens in the twinkling of an eye so suddenly and unexpectedly now.
Yet, as this righteous work is brought to full completion, so too will there be a convergence of evil on the earth as my restrainer is removed. Because there are multiple points of restraint that prevent the fallen ones from having their desired convergence, yet as the faithful in Christ are taken all points of restraint will be removed with my restrainer and Michael will stand up and remove himself and the ice shall fall, and the

The BITTER SWEET

earth will be violently altered so that it will fully be as in the days of Noah, complete with their abominable Nephilim that have been made once again and they will be released. Behold! I bring giants to fulfill my wrath!
Thus, will the earth be given into the hands of the dragon for a short season, even a season of harsh judgment where the dwellers on the earth will fully have the evil and darkness they so lust and desire, except no golden age will they have but harsh and everlasting judgment instead. And the fallen ones will have their war with which they will fully subjugate the earth in full, unrestrained evil, and full unrestrained unrighteousness, and that great scarlet whore will fall to the flames of judgment as Secret Babylon is fully judged and destroyed at the departure of the faithful in Christ, never to rise again! Understand that they will hide themselves away in their underground cities and bunkers, and bases, and shelters, but many of them will not escape but will be buried in the earth in full judgment, even preserved in torment in death until that great white throne judgment and they shall not escape.
Then a revelation and realization will quickly fall over the earth that full judgment and wrath has come over the earth, and who shall be able to stand? Yet, all who call on the name of Jesus until their end will come to full and glorious salvation and a mighty remnant from Israel will accept Yeshua HaMashiach as their true Messiah and will be saved alive into my millennial kingdom. So understand the final separations to come.
Because the righteous remnant of Jacob will be separated from Esau and Ashkenaz, even saved alive by the revealing to be accomplished by my two witnesses, even Enoch the Scribe and Elijah the Tishbite.
Because the luke warm and many of those who previously rejected Jesus the Nazarene will be left to the fires of purification and will be separated from those who marvel after the beast and they will be initially overcome by the beast from the sea in his war on the remaining saints; who will overcome the beast from the sea by calling on Jesus as their Lord until their end and into great glory will they forevermore go!
Because the abominable and unrighteous will be separated fully from the righteous and sealed forevermore by the snakebite that is in the hand of the beast from the earth that will be used to fully ensnare all those who love evil and have pleasure in unrighteousness, and they shall not escape.
And so it is, that the times of revealing are fully enveloping the earth now, and all will be revealed fully in their proper times. At the gathering of the faithful in Christ given by a mighty shout with the voice of the archangel and that last trumpet that will surely sound, those taken into the heavens will no longer see through a glass darkly but will fully understand all things even as they are fully known. And they will see with their own eyes, and they will hear with their own ears, and they will fully see and understand the glory of Yahweh the Great I AM, and also Christ Jesus their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness and what a sweet time will it be as the bridegroom unites fully with his bride in everlasting covenant! And the tables are set and the banquet halls are at the ready!
And so it is, that the times of revealing will fully come over the earth now, and every aspect of the Satans kingdom and orders of unrighteousness will be fully exposed and brought out into full view as judgment falls, because the veil of separation will be lifted just as suddenly and forcefully as the veil in the temple that separated the most Holy place from the lesser Holy place was torn from top to bottom by the mighty hand of Yahweh himself, when I uttered that phrase of eternal victory IT IS FINISHED!
Therefore, understand the times you live and prepare yourselves my loves. Continue in repentance and

plead my atoning blood over your lives and the lives of those you love in intercession, even so that you may have full forgiveness of all things and full remission of sins and many will be saved by your righteous intercessions. Understand that now is the time to fully separate yourselves from the ways of this world and also the cares of this present evil world because so suddenly and unexpectedly will your times living in this sinful world be at an eternal end, and never again will you be subject to evil and unrighteousness. So continue to come out from among them and be separate in all things, although, I do ask you to continue in your courses, working heartily as unto the Lord from full hearts of faith working righteousness until suddenly on the earth you are not!
And so I come to tell my Church, my body, and even my bride that the times of their redemption has come and the times of full celebration and inheritance and reward are set to receive the faithful in Christ into the heavens at my command now, because Yahweh has given all things into my mighty hands to accomplish, and I always do my Father’s will even so that you could be redeemed into full righteousness so that you too would always do the will of your Father in righteous perfection!
Therefore, in the same way that this transfer of ruler-ship will occur in great destruction and war as the fallen ones do what is given into their hands to accomplish at the full judgment of Secret Babylon that sits on many waters that are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; even as they conquer the nations for their unholy rule of which I will make an eternal end at the end of Jacob's trouble.
That in similar fashion, at my second coming, when I return to earth with the heavenly host and the faithful in Christ and even my Bride, that in righteousness I will judge and make war and put down eternally and forevermore with great violence and force all ruler-ship and authority and dominion of the dragon! Because he is no king, and he has no kingdom and his inheritance is in those everlasting flames of punishment where their worm dies not, where he is bound in judgment to go evermore.
And so will my Millennial Kingdom be established on the earth, even governed by my New Testament of righteousness forever and forevermore. Selah!
And so, I Christ Jesus, who is also Jesus the Christ, who is also Yeshua HaMashiach do declare that the times have arrived and the faithful are set to be gathered and the first separation of the first fruits of barley harvest will be harvested and taken into the storehouses and safety of the heavens where you will all receive your eternal reward from my mighty hands according as your faithfulness has been.
Therefore understand:
I am Christ Jesus, who along with Yahweh, the Great I AM, has revealed this announcement as well as The Everlasting Gospel to our mighty messenger in these times of revealing, and to our mighty messenger has Yahweh, the Great I AM and Christ Jesus revealed this announcement as well as The Everlasting Gospel for the obedience and salvation of all these Words are sent.
I am The High Priest after The Order of Melchizedek forevermore, and from my shoulders the mantle of Melchizedek will never depart! Selah!
I am the Everlasting Lord and King of Righteousness Himself: who will appear suddenly as my glory and brightness is seen across the entire earth, even as lightning comes out of the east is seen into the west and the faithful in Christ will be suddenly gathered to their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, and that final trumpet is about to sound fully in the ears of the faithful, as they hear: Come up hither!

I am Jesus the Nazarene who has sent these Words of celebration and announcement to the faithful in Christ, even so they may be fully readied to hear that beautiful trumpet’s call and their eternal invitation to come up hither!
And I am The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness who does close the testimony of my mighty messenger who has heralded faithfully the Words of Righteousness revealed to him by myself, and Yahweh the Great I AM. Therefore, understand that my mighty messenger will be gathered with the faithful and will fulfill his eternal purposes in his inheritance that will be given by my hand to all who overcome in like fashion.
And as the testimony of The Everlasting Gospel, even that Little Book of Revelation Chapter 10 is brought to a close, I do give you to understand that from the start of testimony on March 2nd of 2024, to January 13th, 2025 there has been ten months and eleven days according to the Gregorian calendar, and so I give you to understand that in the same way Revelation chapter ten closes with verse eleven, these same Words are given in understanding and wisdom: And he said to me, You must prophecy again among the people and nations, and tongues, and to many Kings.
And so will come to pass even as written: Then I saw another Angel fly in the midst of heaven, having an everlasting Gospel, to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people: Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him: for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. Selah!
Therefore, hear and understand the first Words given by my hand via the Spirit of Prophecy to my mighty messenger on March 2nd of 2024 that will now book end this testimony given for a total of three hundred and twenty six (326) days to January 22, 2025. Selah!
How long, how long, will my people ignore my call? How long will they cleave to their sins? How long will they live in the pleasures of sin? Repent. Repent. Repent! Turn to me with your entire heart. Turn to the Lord your God and to my outstretched arms!
To my Bride: I have given you life, yet your life is hid in me; and when I shall appear, so too shall you appear in the life that I have given you. You have freely received, yet it cost me a great price for your ransom. Will you use my grace as a time to slumber? Or will you use my grace as a time to purify yourselves by virtue of my blood that I shed for you at Calvary? Will you accept my invitation to preach to a dying world and save many of your brethren? Or will you ignore my invitation and instead prefer the pleasures of sin for a closing season?
To all, I say: Return to me with your whole heart; repent with your entire being! Seek my face and accept my forgiveness, as the day of the Lord is at hand, as I have warned my people. I will not be quiet, and I urge you to open your mouths to save those you love and those I will bring to you. Remember your first love, and come to me before the trumpet sounds.
Therefore, tell my people I am coming for them and that I am Christ Jesus their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness who will never leave them nor forsake them.
Selah!

The Mighty Gathering of the Faithful in Christ. Addendum
FEBRUARY 01, 2025
Hear the Words of your Everlasting Lord, my church, my body, and even my bride, and bow your ears in obedience to the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach. Hear my voice and come to your Lord with ready hearts to receive my Words, even so that comfort may come over you fully, because the times of comfort and full redemption are upon you my loves, therefore be ready!
As it is, I Jesus the Nazarene, even he who is also Yeshua HaMashiach in the Hebrew tongue, do come to ready you my loves because there is no more time and the gathering of the faithful in Christ is set to begin so suddenly and unexpectedly now. So fear not my loves, and understand that the judgments of those who have refused my warnings are not for you, and you will be saved fully from the wrath to come! Truly, truly, because you have believed and accepted salvation and remission of sins in the new birth according to my New Testament during the times of grace and mercy you are absolutely saved from the wrath to come!
Yet, so it is, that many unstable and insincere souls who speak lies in hypocrisy and twist my Words to their own judgment and destruction, who by sleight of hand and prideful boasting of the flesh claim that they are the great power of Yahweh, and do lead astray all who hear and obey their lies told from deceitful hearts. Therefore, understand my promises that I revealed to Paul when I taught him The Great Mystery of God that is fully revealed in his epistles, even a mystery that so many of you still do not understand. Nevertheless, he did witness and testify concerning Yahweh's wrath: But God commends his love towards us, seeing that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life!
Oh, you of little faith, how long shall I endure you, my loves? So I come to give you comfort because I will never leave you nor forsake you, even all of you who are in Christ, and truly I will endure with you for all eternity because you will forever be with me and forever be like me. Selah.
Therefore, understand that all who live godly will suffer persecution in one form or another, and that toothless lion still wanders about seeking whom he may devour, so resist him fully and he will flee. However, the gates of hell will not prevail against my Church neither against the faithful in my Church who obey my voice and who I do empower mightily by my spirit of Sonship created within all who have made me Lord from a faith filled heart, and you are sealed with the seal of The Everlasting God of Righteousness, even Yahweh the Great I AM, and that seal cannot be broken and neither can you be plucked from my hands, though they lie!
Wherefore, understand that you are saved from wrath, and you are saved from all wrath. So understand that the wrath of the Lamb is not intended for the obedient, but to begin final judgment on the fallen ones and all who fully join or remain with them, and to bring final salvation to the disobedient and stubborn who will obey The Everlasting Gospel in their times of distress and calamity because they ignored my warnings in the times of warning that is now at an end, and in warnings place, declarations now stand!! Yet, all the faithful in Christ, even all those who are adopted fully as eternal Sons of Yahweh and are now grafted into the natural Olive tree of The Israel of God where all fullness does dwell are not subject to the wrath of the Lamb, and neither the wrath of Yahweh, Selah!

Because the wrath of the Lamb comes first and will fall hard and heavy on the disobedient and unfaithful of the house of God, whether they are of Israel or the nations. Because this is a mercy given by promise from covenants of old that is still promised and set for fulfillment for all time and eternity forevermore in my New Testament of complete fulfillment! The wrath of the Lamb comes when I loosen the seals on my scroll of inheritance, even the deed to the earth and even my mighty inheritance that has been given into my mighty hands by Yahweh Himself to share with my overcomers because in all things have I overcome! The two witnesses will rise in their time and great and mighty wonders will they do, and many revelations will they reveal, and many testimonies of old will they testify in their appointed times of revealing, and they will command many plagues, miracles, signs, and wonders by the Words and commands of their faith filled hearts and power-filled mouths! Selah.
Also, during this time it is given to the dragon, the beast from the sea, and the false prophet to make war on the saints and to overcome them. Yet, those who love their lives not to the end and all who call on the name of Jesus until their end will achieve eternal salvation and a mighty eternal inheritance of whose weight is not worthy to be compared to their sufferings they will endure for my namesake. And I, Yeshua HaMashiach, will lead my mighty 144,000 for the rescue of Jacob, even that mighty remnant who will accept me as their Messiah, even all from Israel who are of the actual bloodlines of promise and will be separated and taken alive into the wilderness to a place prepared for them of Yahweh where they will remain hidden safely away from the greatest tribulation to ever overtake the earth, and truly times of trouble will never overtake the earth again, for so has Yahweh, The Great I AM, declared!
Therefore, understand my Words and hearken to my voice my loves, and understand that you are saved from the wrath to come, even though you are all still on earth and are all still fighting many battles that rage in these times of finality of the seed war of Genesis 3:15 that still rages to this day between Yahweh, and the heavens, and the satans who have hijacked evil men on earth to do their bidding by the love of money and many deceptive and promising lies that ultimately lead to the lake of fire where their worm dies not. Nevertheless, I have overcome them and all wars will cease at the mighty power and forceful hand of The Lion of the Tribe of Judah, when in righteousness I come to judge and make war! Selah.
Yes, you are saved from wrath and the gates of hell will not prevail against you! Therefore, present yourselves to Christ Jesus your eternal Lord, even he who has redeemed you from the hand of the enemy, yes present yourselves to your Lord because the times of your heavenly presentation is at hand. Even a time of eternal expectation hidden in the heart of Yahweh that has now been revealed fully, even a time when eternal promise and expectation meets fulfillment and presentation because, I, Christ Jesus, even your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness will present the faithful in Christ to Yahweh, The Great I AM, in his throne room in the heaven of the heavens.
And I WILL present the obedient, without spot nor blemish, nor stain, nor any such thing but will clothe you all fully in fine white, spotless linen and so will your houses remain forevermore, because garments, clothes, and houses all refer to your resurrected and perfect bodies that so suddenly now you will find yourselves standing in forevermore when I recreate the faithful in Christ in the twinkling of an eye at that great and mighty shout of the Archangel and that sweet trumpet of consummation will sound, officially ending my times of Grace and mercy, that will mark a full end to the times of the gentiles, although, all who call on the name of Jesus the Nazarene to the end will be saved to the uttermost.

And so I come to expose those who would trouble you, even all those so many of you still give heed to their cankerous words, even false words given in deceit from evil hearts governed by the lusts of their flesh. Even those who pervert the pure Words of my gospel with fables and unholy narratives that are lies, wholly intended for the destruction of all those who would believe these faithless words. My loves, focus your full attention on me and my Word because I am the stability of your times and strength of salvation, and who is it who can stand against The Lion of the Tribe of Judah!?
Behold! I have protected my pure Words in the Byzantine line of Texts and I Yeshua HaMashiach, as well as Adonai Yahweh, have revealed our Words in The Everlasting Gospel, even in that Little Book of Righteousness that has reestablished many truths amongst the faithful in Christ, therefore, compare diligently every word from any entity who claims to speak for Yeshua HaMashiach, or Yahweh, The Great I AM to my pure Words contained in scripture and study to show yourselves approved!
Because any prophesy ever given by Yeshua HaMashiach or Adonai Yahweh, will never contradict established truths that were revealed in the times of old and neither the times of now. Repudiate their lies and understand that the faithful in Christ will not endure thick darkness as the plagues of Egypt, neither will they be present on earth when the abyss is opened, and neither will my Church be overcome by the gates of hell, that they should hide away in their homes like cowards who are powerless over evil! Understand, the blasphemy of all who say these things will not go unrewarded for all who refuse repentance from such foolishness.
Understand further, the 144,000 are chosen by Yahweh before the foundations of the earth for such a time. They are forged in affliction and all posses unique abilities and strengths. They will be taken in the rapture of the faithful but are set apart for Yeshua HaMashiach's purposes and will be accordingly sealed in their foreheads in the heavens. They come later to the earth during the great tribulation to lead Israel to safety. But first they are taken to marry their Bridegroom for they are my Bride, the called, chosen, faithful, and true. Even those whom I, Christ Jesus, have made pure as a virgin in my atoning blood. Therefore, anyone who speaks contrary to these Words does not know me, neither speaks for me! Selah!
Therefore understand, that the gates of hell will not prevail against the faithful in Christ who are my true Church for so has it been written and promised of old, and so it is still written and promised in the times of now, because the Words of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach are pure words as silver, tried in a furnace of earth, refined seven fold. Yes, the fallen ones are powerless against the faithful in Christ and I will cause my faithful to trample underfoot any aspect of the enemies kingdom, even trampling those who would seek to stop the unstoppable.
Therefore, I command you to have faith in your Everlasting Lord and allow The Everlasting God of Righteousness to infuse you with inner strength in the face of your Lord, Christ Jesus! Walk out with great faith in Yeshua HaMashiach, who is Jesus the Nazarene because I have empowered you that you may trample underfoot all aspects of the enemies kingdom. Therefore, understand, that even the fallen angels are under my feet in utter defeat, and should you encounter Satan himself you would only need to answer as Michael answered when contending for the body of Moses, saying in powerful faith, The Lord rebuke you Satan! And I will rebuke, and bind any of the fallen ones who would try to harm or stop you from doing the will of he who has sent you, should you continue to walk faithfully in faith as you speak the Words that I will give you in faith.

And so I command you my loves to ready yourselves, because your departure is at hand! And I do come to warn you to remain separate from Secret Babylon in all things and in as many ways as I will lead you for your sanctification and separation. Heed the Words of The Everlasting Gospel and allow my all truth that has been revealed in these times of revealing to be a lamp unto your feet even so that your path is enlightened, because there is but one path, even that straight and narrow way that leads to eternal life in Christ Jesus your eternal Lord!
Ready yourselves, my bride and buy oil of me that your lamps may be filled! My oil is found in my Words my love, even in the very Words you now read and I have given you multitudes of Words to comfort, keep, and guide you into all righteousness where that wicked one touches you not!
Ready yourselves, my loves, because it is always time to trim your wicks, and you will trim your wicks by repentance of sins and producing fruit of the spirit as you overcome the works of the flesh by way of my holy spirit that is born within you fully, and can never be removed once it has rooted itself into the hearts of men in all holiness and righteousness. Keep your hearts always soft to my love and instructions, even so that you are kept fully safe and protected from all evil in the palm of my eternal hands.
Ready yourselves, O' Faithful in Christ, and understand the nearness of the final hour when the gathering of the faithful in Christ occurs, snatching you all away into the full safety and reward of the heavens that is now set to engulf the earth in my glorious appearing. As my glory shines like lightning out of the east into the west, many of you will see the brightness of my coming.
Then, truly, truly, when the mighty shout of the Archangel breaks across the world, as that mighty trumpet blast is heralded across the earth, the dead in Christ will be birthed out of the earth with great and mighty force and power; then you which are alive and remain will be caught up with them to meet your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness in the air, and you will instantly find yourselves clothed in full glory and a very bright and glorious nature, standing in the heaven of heavens. You will see fully, you will hear fully, you will know even as you are known, and many of you will be reunited with your loved ones and all will rejoice!
You who are alive and remain will understand the event you suddenly find yourselves engulfed and you will hear the Words "Come up Hither!" and you will feel yourselves pulled mightily and swiftly upwards into the brightness of my glory and the birth pangs will cease as the eternal children of Yahweh are birthed into the heavens where they will stand in great glory and eternal reward according as their faithfulness has been.
It is I, Christ Jesus, The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness who has sent these Words by my mighty messenger and servant, and by my mighty messenger and servant have my Words been sent, even so that the faithful in Christ may be fully readied and waiting for the approach of their Bridegroom, who is now approaching for his bride! Selah.
Ready yourselves, O' Faithful ones in Christ, because the hour of your full redemption is about to suddenly and unexpectedly take you away from all troubles that will fall on the earth in great and terrible judgment because the times of judgment have come and must be fulfilled, only completely separate yourselves in all things in word and in deed from the faithless so you do not share in their judgments, nor share in their plagues.
Ready yourselves, my Bride, and come fully to me in full repentance and depart from all evil so that your lamps are full and your wicks are trimmed and that you may be readied for your Bridegroom who surely

approaches and the hour of my journey nears completion! Selah!
To my church, my body, and even my bride, I say your times of your full redemption have come, therefore, wait for me and be at the ready and hold fast to the testimonies I have given because these testimonies will sustain you and keep you from the evil one who surely comes against you with great hate and wrath that is not intended for you. Understand, that I do rebuke and restrain the fallen ones more than any of you realize and they are restrained until my restrainer is removed. Therefore, keep yourselves separate from the judged masses and do not participate in their gatherings because they already bring chaos and destruction to those who will be given fully to judgment so suddenly as my restrainer is removed. Therefore, do not fear the things they say, neither fear the things they do and neither fear the things they are planning and boasting that they will surely do, because these things are not for the faithful in Christ, wherefore, fear them not.
Who can stand against The Lion of the Tribe of Judah and the full fury and power of my might!? Hear my Words and hear me well, even all of you fallen ones from the least to the greatest. I, Jesus the Christ, even Christ Jesus, am he declares in the throne and power of Yahweh, The Great I AM, that I am he who is coming to, and absolutely will take full possession of all who are redeemed fully by my atoning blood and sealed with the seal of the living God, even Yahweh, The Great I AM, and their times have come. Therefore, I will not be denied and your efforts to resist me will collapse fully on the heads of those you send to try. Who is it amongst you that can stand against my power and might!? Who?!
The will of Yahweh, the Great I AM be eternally done, once, all and eternally more! Behold, I approach, and all who seek to hinder will be overwhelmed in utter defeat and judgment of which they will not escape, eternally and forevermore. Selah!
To the Faithful in Christ, I again say:
Ready yourselves in all obedience and love,
Yeshua HaMashiach, The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness.

A Segue for The Faithful in Christ, Then Sudden Destruction on Earth.
FEBRUARY 24, 2025
Behold! Great and powerful transitions are underway, and the transfer is almost complete, even as the earth is transitioned from the Kingdom of Heaven where the earth is ruled under the New Testament and evil is restrained to the Kingdom of the Dragon, of which they lust. As it has been during my times of grace and mercy on the earth that started with that great day of Pentecost these many Jubilees ago, it will now no longer be. Even a transfer from my New Testament, to the rule of the Dragon, beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth who is also their false prophet, but never is my New Testament made void because truly, truly, my New Testament is an eternal Testament, even a Testament that Yahweh has accepted for all times and forevermore, Selah.
Behold! A transfer of power from the Kingdom of Heaven to the final beast system, of which there shall never be another. Behold! I am Yeshua HaMashiach and I do come to bring good tidings of peace and joy to the faithful in Christ, even so that your joy may be full, and you are not downcast in your expectation and that you do not lose focus for your hope, which is so suddenly to be revealed when I appear in the clouds so unexpectedly now, and you will be taken. For, I do come to snatch away the faithful in Christ into the heavens, and who is there who can stop my mighty hand? I say who?!
Because I do come with the full power and authority of the throne of Yahweh himself and I do come to take my possession that I have purchased in my own redeeming blood, even my own sinless blood that I willingly gave in great strength and unbreakable love for the sins of the world. Even so that the sins of Adam would rest on Jesus the Nazarene, even he whom John the Baptist identified with the Words "Behold! The lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world!"
So it is, that truly, truly, I have paid the penalty of Moses for all who have accepted Jesus the Nazarene as their peace treaty between themselves and Yahweh, because Adam is the prodigal son who disobeyed Yahweh and became subject to the swine herd of Satan as the servants of sin. Nevertheless, my Words remain sure because he who is the servant of sin does not remain in subjection to the Kingdom of Satan should they accept and confess Jesus as Lord. Truly, truly, the servant does not remain in the house of sin forever should they choose to accept eternal salvation in Jesus the Christ because no other name will ever be given for the salvation of Adam, and the fallen ones have never forgiveness.
Nevertheless, those who refuse my invitation and all those who have altered themselves in the ways of Canaan and all those who will take the mark of the beast will remain in the house of sin forever because those who become the sons of sin will remain under the power of the serpents genetic corruptions forevermore, and all those who commit blasphemy against the name of Yahweh, of which Adam was created, have never forgiveness, indeed that which has made itself crooked cannot be made straight. Therefore, in Yahweh's perfect justice all those who fully commit the sins of the fallen ones and alter their own genetics have committed the sin unto death, even as I had John the Revelator write in his letters to the faithful in Christ. And all those who reject the holy and sinless blood of Jesus the Nazarene as an unholy thing will join the fallen ones in their inheritance of burning brimstone, because truly, truly your

redemption cost me a terrible price that I would willingly pay again, even though such a thing is eternally unneeded.
Why are you downcast, my loves? Why does your enthusiasm wane? May I ask what bride sits somber in sadness, even as the bridegroom approaches? Even as your bridegroom has declared his nearness of arrival, yet so many of you are sad in heart as if I have rejected you? Yet, so it is that those who are closest in time to the great gathering of the faithful in Christ have somehow allowed themselves to lose their excitement, even so by listening to the faithless reasonings of false prophets and ministers, and by allowing fiery darts to nest in their minds that would overthrow their faith if left unquenched by my Words and spirit! For my Words, they are spirit, and they are life to those who walk by faith! Therefore, do not allow yourselves to forget that there is a crown of righteousness laid up for all who love my appearing, only relinquish not your crowns my loves, because Satan does seek to rob you of your inheritance.
Why is my bride long of face in sadness and disappointment, as if they have been jilted by an unfaithful bridegroom? Have, I Christ Jesus, ever given you unfaithful Words, or have I ever lied to you, my loves? No, indeed I am The Ever Faithful and Everlasting Lord of Righteousness with whom is always yea and amen because I am he in whom all promises of Yahweh and Yeshua HaMashiach meet fulfillment for all eternity. Therefore, understand the nature of the change that is about to be accomplished in you, even you whom I address, even the faithful in Christ! Even my church, my body, and even my Bride, to whom I send these Words of comfort! So rejoice!
So many of you consider the new birth as power over your sins, and truly I do empower you over your sins so that you may be victorious and overcome in all things, however the new birth is more than overcoming sins. Even though I have sealed the faithful in Christ, even that unbreakable seal of Yahweh himself, even with that spirit of sonship that is in itself not the fullness of the new birth, but a down payment for the purchased possession of their impending and promised full redemption. Even as it is written, In whom also you have trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, even the Gospel of your salvation, wherein also after that ye believed, you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance, for the redemption of that liberty purchased unto the praise of his glory.
Therefore, the seal of the living God remains sure and steadfast on all I have sealed, and you may call yourselves born again, and truly I have empowered you with my new nature so that you may walk righteously and upright in all obedience of faith as you walk by the spirit, because the just shall live by faith! Therefore, understand that even though you have all faith, and all manifestations of power, and even all gifts and enablements are given in that spirit of sonship you received when you were sealed, the full power and magnificence of the new birth will not be realized until suddenly on the earth you are not!
Because, I do come to snatch you away into the heavens, even where you will marvel at the splendor with which you will be recreated and clothed. You will stand in the throne room of Yahweh where I will present the Lights of the World to the Father of Lights and you will see and you will know and you will hear and you will understand. And as you stand glorified in great glory before the throne of everlasting glory, you will shine as the stars in the firmament of heaven, and you will have a bright nature. And an angel will seal my 144,000 in their foreheads and many enablements, abilities, and powers will you all have according as your faithfulness has been. Because in that moment you will all be forevermore part of the eternal Godhead forevermore, never to depart. Selah.

And at that point in time where the gathering together of the faithful in Christ to their Everlasting Lord of Righteousness occurs so suddenly and unexpectedly now, even all those who hear the sound of that last trumpet, and who hear the Words "Come up hither" will suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves born again even as a new and perfect and sinless and glorified creation, fashioned even after your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness; because I am the Last Adam who has been made a life giving spirit and your full salvation is at your door.
Therefore, I do come to tell you once again to ready yourselves and have your full expectation of full redemption in the forefront of your minds and hearts, because truly your times have come. Therefore, prepare yourselves by departing from all sins and all appearance of evil. Continue to come out of this sin filled and judged world that you do not partake of their plagues and judgments in the least.
Confess your sins to me, Christ Jesus, and ask me regarding your lives that I may show your sins and shortcomings to you that perhaps you are not aware, and even so the Love of Yahweh covers a multitude of sins because it is impossible that you should confess them all. Arrange your affairs and understand that your life on this earth in sinful flesh is at an end and no longer will you have the accursed option of following a sin nature that demands your attention and obedience in all unrighteousness, but you will be born again, born from above, even born newly alive for all eternity never to sin and never to die again, and it is I Christ Jesus who does so declare and you will be clothed in full righteousness, ever free from the corruptions of sin forevermore.
I am Christ Jesus, and I have sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent, even so that my church, my body, and even my bride will stand fast in earnest and excited expectation of their full redemption that is about to break across the earth even as lightning comes out of the east and into the west and you will all be changed in the twinkling of an eye!
Then shall it happen, even as foretold, that sudden destruction will fall on Secret Babylon and her coasts will be covered, she shall be split along the middle from the gulf to the lakes, great fire will fall and their missiles will be launched, even my mighty Angel will cast a great stone into the sea and Secret Babylons greatest city shall not escape, nor the city of Angels because truly, truly, will her sinful cities will burn and be overthrown. The armies of the beast will be released and they shall hunt every person and will cull multitudes, and they have orders to eliminate all who do not suit their purposes, or who could rise to fight them another day. Thus, so shall their third world war occur.
Great shaking and total war will destroy many nations and cities and towns and the earth will be divided in many places, and the restrainer shall be suddenly removed, and the ice shall fall, and their abominations will be unleashed and the abyss will be opened and Satans full kingdom will be unleashed and united in evil in their war against the saints wherewith they shall overcome them even as written. And great judgment shall suddenly fall, even as warned, and declared and so shall it be that great judgment will fall across the entire earth when the transfer is completed. And this because natural man desires the fallen ones and desires their evil and darkness, therefore, evil and darkness will natural man now have and his only escape is to call on the name of Jesus until his end, because the rebellious of Adam will now be given fully to the Satans who will destroy. Yet, I will come to save a mighty remnant from Jacob at the hands of my mighty 144,000! Selah!

I am, Christ Jesus, and I have previously declared the gathering of the faithful in Christ to their Everlasting and Eternal Lord, even in the Gospel of Salvation and The Mystery of God and The Everlasting Gospel and I do come to establish the surety of my declarations and also the declarations of Yahweh, for whatever declarations are made in the throne and power of Yahweh will come to pass exactly as declared and there will be no more delay.
I am your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness, and I do come to reprove as many as I love, because it is not proper that anyone of the faithful in Christ, even my very Bride who have overcome all things even as I overcame should sit downcast as if your hope of redemption in the full new birth in the heaven of heavens has been put on hold or delayed or that perhaps your Lord tarried by the wayside in unfaithfulness. God forbid an impossibility that will never occur!
For such things are an impossibility, although Satan would seek to tear your faith down with his fiery darts, therefore, quench his darts with the shield of faith, (and even all of my enablements I have given you) and stand in earnest and excited expectation for my appearing. Fret not over the date setters and the many voices who peep and mutter, but look to your Lord of Lords and King of Kings who is approaching and who will do exactly as has been declared in the throne of Yahweh.
And so I ask, who is there who can stop my mighty hand from snatching away those I love and have sealed with the holy spirit of promise so that you may bring symmetry to the heavens and bring righteousness to the earth when you come to rule with your King of Kings and Lord of Lords, even a mighty rule under The High Priest forever after the Order of Melchizedek? Selah!
Behold, I am near. Therefore, watch in all earnest expectation because the faithful in Christ will not be left to the refiners fire in great disappointment. Truly, you have overcome. Selah.

Behold! I Come: A Love Letter of Comfort to the Faithful in Christ.
MARCH 14, 2025
Hear the Words of Yeshua HaMashiach and receive my Words of comfort and hear my Words of joy, for your full redemption has come and is at hand. Truly, truly, I am he who is coming for my Church and your bridegroom lingers not my bride, so stand firm in great faith and allow my Words and my power and might to be the stability of your times and strength of salvation, and the fear of the Lord is your treasure.
Even so the times are upon you my loves and the times of my full revealing has come. And I will reveal myself to each in turn. I will first reveal myself fully to the faithful in Christ in the heavens, so suddenly and unexpectedly now at that mighty shout of the Archangel, and that mighty trumpet shall sound because it has been given in hand to sound at my command at that exact perfect moment chosen by Yahweh himself in eternities past! Even in his eternal and everlasting plans of salvation for the race of Adam and its voice will fill the earth and the Faithful in Christ will hear "Come up hither!" so suddenly and so unexpectedly now.
But the unfaithful and stubborn will be left behind with the fallen ones and the faithless to call on my name to their end, and all who do will be taken into everlasting salvation and glory, even an eternal reward of whose merit and weight truly is not worthy to compare to the sufferings and trials of this earth, that are minuscule and insignificant in comparison. So says he who suffered the full punishment of your sins in my own sinless flesh, shedding in great agony my own sinless blood to the last drop, and I held nothing back for you my loves. Therefore, look unto me, Jesus the Nazarene, even the lamb of God who is the author and finisher of your faith, who for the joy that was set before me, endured the cross, despising the shame, and I am set at the right hand of the throne of God. Selah!
Even so you, the faithful in Christ, will all be taken to the heaven of heavens where I will present you to Yahweh himself! And you will marvel at the splendor with which you will be clothed, and you will know even as you are known, and you will see even as you have been seen, and you will hear even as you have been heard by the Everlasting God of Righteousness, even Yahweh himself who remembers every Word in every prayer that you have ever uttered whether out loud by your faculties of communication, or quietly within your hearts, because Yahweh is the searcher of hearts, and what is there that can be hidden from his sight? Truly, truly, what is there that can be hidden from my sight? Therefore, understand that my Father and I are one in unity and purpose and all that the Father has, he has given into my hands for the salvation of Adam, and truly the salvation and sanctification of the earth itself, because the earth is mine and in righteousness I do come to judge and make war on the fallen ones whose times have come, and their full judgment lingers not and they shall not escape.
Therefore, I give you to understand my loves to stand firm for me and continue to keep your lamps filled with the oil of my spirit that I have provided for you and walk by and in my spirit of Righteousness as you walk by faith because the just shall live by faith, Selah! And so that you are not tempted to go at this late hour in the power of your own might to fill your lamps with impure oil based on your own works, but fill your lamps with the pure oil of my spirit so that your ways may be illumined, because truly, truly, my Word

is a lamp unto your feet. And I have filled you all to the fullest with my spirit of Sonship and I have poured out my spirit in these last days even as promised of Joel in the writings of Old given to my Fathers, who are your Fathers by inheritance of promise because you are the children of promise, even the children of Faithful Abraham, Selah!
Allow me to instruct you on how to trim your wicks because you are the lights of the World that cannot be hid! It is by way of my Words and spirit that you receive instructions in righteousness, and by my spirit of sonship you are convicted of righteousness, that truly, truly, you may live righteously in all things. Because it is by my spirit of sonship that my true righteousness is imparted within you, where truly, truly you all have a choice as to whom you will obey, whether you obey sin unto death, or obedience unto righteousness unto eternal life and full reward. Therefore, obey my specific instructions for your lives and be meek to my voice and to the voices of those I send and who speak for me, and by their fruits you will know them, and by their Words that I do give them for your salvation and well-being. And I do command you to work out your own salvation in fear and trembling, and I do command you to not withhold good when it is in the power of your hands to accomplish.
Therefore, understand that I have empowered and enabled many of you for my purposes of salvation and that you should support one another in love. Therefore, do not hoard the material and financial goodness that I have given you, even hoarding from others in the ways of Satan who seeks to put weights and measures on the goodness of Yahweh, that is truly immeasurable because no scale exists in heaven or earth sufficient to measure the abundance of Yahweh he has prepared in the face of Jesus Christ for those who love him.
Therefore, come out from amongst them fully and do not partake of their sins, do not hoard to yourselves Yahweh's monetary and material abundance given in the face of Jesus Christ as if by the power of your own hand you have accomplished this bounty to be hidden away and hoarded for your lusts. Even so that you may take comfort that you have provided for yourselves in pride and sin, that you would sneer at those without, even delighting in the numbers in your accounts in great shame.
Therefore, understand and be warned that all who do such things from the greatest to the least, shall suffer great loss of reward and will truly take to themselves the designation of the lowest in the kingdom of heaven! And that because by virtue of your own greed will your works burn to ashes at my judgment seat where you all will stand and give an account. Therefore, distribute all things to the necessity of the saints in love for one another and withhold no good thing, because truly, truly, your material and monetary abundance has been given by my hand for my purposes from the storehouses of Yahweh, therefore, do not hoard the goodness of the Lord but accomplish those things in which I will direct your steps in service and love to the saints.
Come out from your sins my people, lest you partake of their judgments, because these are the ways of Secret Babylon and the times of her judgment has come, and powerful is Adonai Yahweh who judges her with a double portion of judgment, therefore depart from her ways and sins that are unacceptable and utterly evil in my sight! Selah!
Yeah, of a truth, I counsel one and all to continue to come out of your sins and come fully into my righteousness, and allow me to be your sufficiency in all things, because truly, truly, I am.

I am he who is coming in the clouds for the faithful in Christ so suddenly and unexpectedly now, because the world, in its faithlessness, does not expect Christ Jesus to appear in the clouds as promised in scripture. Yet, this moment will not overtake you my loves as a thief in the night, should you remain meek to my instructions and follow the details of my commandments with your entire hearts, knowing that for your diligence and faithfulness comes the full rewards of the inheritance of the faithful in Christ, that truly, has not entered fully into the hearts of men at this time. Therefore, do not allow Satan to purchase your rewards of inheritance in the ways of Esau, who was a profane person and fornicator who sold his birthright for a bowl of pottage that was cast out in the drought. Selah!
Therefore, understand the nearness in time of my appearing and how close your full redemption is, my loves. Wherefore, I give you to understand that the host of heaven has taken their places in their orders and formations, and they have presented themselves for service, and they stand at the ready. They have taken their places, and they are at the ready! Therefore, understand, that I hold that mighty trumpet in hand, that at my command the dead in Christ shall be raised incorruptible, and you which are alive and remain will be taken suddenly to meet me in the clouds and so shall you all be forever made like your Lord, and for those who have fully overcome will always be with me because I will take you to myself in covenant as my very own, and many mighty works will you do, because my bride is a mighty host of Prophets, Kings, and Priests who will be empowered with a great empowerment as my warrior bride, and who is there who shall be able to stand against my bride of empowered immortals who are redeemed from the earth in great power and righteousness, Selah!
Therefore, understand that the exact time chosen by Yahweh in his foreknowledge has always been an exact day, time and hour, except it was hidden in Yahweh's heart alone until the proper times of its revealing came to pass in the heavens alone, because this time is not revealed on earth, although Satan stands at the ready to devour all who are left and remain on the earth, therefore, all who call on the name of Jesus to their end shall be saved. Understand that this exact time has not been given to Satan either but he must stand at the ready until he is released for his short rule after which he will be bound with a great chain in the abyss in torment and agony where he will fully understand his coming inheritance.
And so it is that I come to give you understanding of the times you live and I do so by giving you once again the very Words that I gave Peter to address the masses on that great day of Pentecost these many Jubilees past now, where nevertheless, his Words ring true evermore in fulfillment eternally and evermore. So I say to you that this is that, which was spoken by the Prophet Joel, And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons, and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. And on my servants, and on mine handmaids I will pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in heaven above, and tokens in the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and the vapors of smoke. The Sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come. And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord, shall be saved.
Therefore, I do come to declare these Words fulfilled in your ears this very day, and that so suddenly and unexpected now the faithful in Christ will be taken and redeemed and changed and glorified and rewarded forevermore. So understand the sudden fulfillment that is so suddenly to come. Do not give ear to the date

setters and the Judaizers who do not understand neither what they teach, neither the real truth of scripture they wrest to their own detriment.
Wherefore, I give you to understand that the gathering of the faithful in Christ is not tied specifically to any holy day, nor feast days, nor any other date or event given to ancient Israel in the law of Moses, even which law is fulfilled fully in Christ Jesus your Everlasting Lord of Righteousness. As I have told you in times past I tell you again my loves: Let no man therefore condemn you in meat and drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days, Which are but a shadow of things to come: but the body is in Christ.
However, do understand that this event can happen at any second and on any day and very well might happen on a significant day, time, or hour or even during holy days, or feast days, or the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come! Therefore, wait and watch and give earnest expectation to my appearing because your times of your full redemption has come. And so I give you to understand and also for your obedience, that you wait and watch every day (and not just your self appointed high watch times) and that you give the more earnest heed to these Words in full expectation of fulfillment, because there is no more delay. Selah!
I am Christ Jesus and I am he who has sent these Words by my messenger and servant and by my messenger and servant have these Words been sent. Even as encouragement so my Church, my body, and even my Bride may be comforted with great comfort and that you may understand fully the exact nearness in time of this event, so that you are not overtaken in surprise of this event that is sure to happen so suddenly now.
I am Yeshua HaMashiach who will now move to send my two witnesses and my two candlesticks, even as declared in The Everlasting Gospel, because Yahweh has never left himself without witness, and my two witnesses will witness of all times and from an earthly and heavenly perspective, and Enoch the Scribe does bring the writings of old in his scrip and their testimonies will be added to The Everlasting Gospel that will endure evermore along with all the Words of Yahweh that will be restored to the earth in exact perfection as recorded in the heavens, even so that the works of the devil might be fully undone and that the ways and Words of Yahweh may flood the earth in righteousness for all times and forevermore! Selah.
Behold! I am he who comes in the clouds and my times of revealing are at hand.
Are you watching my loves? Is your expectation fervent and alive?
I do command you to receive my Words in full and watch, and wait, and be at the ready.
Until suddenly... On earth... You are not.
Behold! The exact second of redemption approaches and is in sight.
	Consider my Words and blessings of benediction that surely will endure into the eternity of eternities forevermore. Selah!
Receive my Love Letter my Bride for I have delivered it for your comfort and expectation.
In the Love of Yahweh given to me to you-ward,
Yeshua HaMashiach: The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness.

A Final Call Before Finality Falls on The Judged.
MARCH 20, 2025
Behold! I AM Yahweh, the Great I AM, and I do come to send my Words of love and a final call to those who face finality of judgment should they refuse my final call. Even though, all who call on the name of Jesus until the end will achieve great and eternal salvation and great reward, many many men will fall to judgment on account of their sins and hardness of heart. Because, I AM he who convicts the unrighteous to repent, and those who refuse repentance I continue to convict until their hearts are fully hardened and they are taken in judgment.
Therefore, I do come to give this message in my love for you, and send my undeserved grace to a judged world yet again in my efforts to soften your impenitent hearts to accept salvation; or that in your hate and rebellion you are left in a state of final refusal ripe and ready for final judgment. Understand, there is no more time in my times of grace and mercy for a lifetime of repentance on account of my plans of salvation for all of mankind who will come to full salvation in their times and orders for those who will accept my love for them. Therefore, your times are now and a final call is now being sent. Selah.
Hear, O' Hear the voice of The Great Eternal God of Righteousness, even Yahweh, The Great I AM, who is also The Everlasting God of Righteousness and understand the meaning of my speech, and know that my voice is as the sound of many rushing and living waters, and understand that my voice rumbles as the sound of many thunders, (even the thunders of thunders) in my righteous indignation for the dwellers on the earth who dwell therein in great disobedience, and in great unrighteousness and sin.
Behold! I AM that I AM, even The Great I AM, and I have created the heavens and the earth and all the fullness therein, and in my righteous design I made the heavens and the earth perfect in my ways of perfection, even creating them in harmonious and righteous perfection where all of my creations were to live in harmonious perfection and love and service in love one to another. And in their love for their Father and creator, they would obey my voice and commandments for their lives that indeed they may understand themselves as they were created and also understand my ways. Nevertheless, iniquity was found in Heylel, even he who fell from glorious perfection, even he who was created in great and awesome splendor, only to fall to the earth, degraded in sin and darkness to inhabit the form of a snake who are accursed on account of the disobedience of Seraphim. Selah.
Because of an eternal truth, my ways are higher than the ways of man, and I AM he who has surrounded my throne with ten thousand times ten thousand, even an innumerable number of angels who excel in wisdom, power, and might, and who love Yahweh and who love to learn the ways of Yahweh, the Great I AM in all fervent and ever faithful obedience: Selah.
Truly, of a great and eternal truth, I have created them powerful and glorious and clothed them in bright splendor, and eternal righteousness, and everlasting honor. Truly, of a great and eternal truth, they have never lacked in want or need not even in the tiniest matters ever; and they do serve me and my creation fully in their hearts of love for their Father and creator, even Elohim, in their obedience to Christ Jesus.
(Even He whom, Yahweh, The Great and Everlasting I AM has placed all things in heaven and earth into his mighty and everlasting and obedient hands.)

Therefore know of an eternal truth that Christ Jesus is Lord of Lords and King of Kings and he it is who will bring peace to the heavens as well as the earth and he it is who will return to my glorious hand (in his love for his Father and Creator, Elohim, even the Great I AM) the subjected Kingdom at the end of all things when his mighty hands shall have accomplished all things that are written and foretold regarding The Everlasting Lord of Righteousness! Even when that Son of Man shall have completed all things in great power, and in greater love. Even so at which time, I will have accomplished in my power by his mighty hands and sacrifice all things given in my eternal plans and mysteries for him to accomplish.
Therefore, I give you to understand, that I AM he who in all power and sovereignty can literally understand, accomplish, fully know, and control every detail pertaining to every aspect of my creation no matter how large or seemingly powerful to the minutest detail, and nothing can be hidden from my sight! I AM he who can literally accomplish all things instantly in my might and eternal power, however, I am also he who works all things after the counsel of my own will and who needs no counselor, therefore, my plans and mysteries will be fully fulfilled in these times of their fulfillment, even the times of NOW.
Nevertheless, in my love for my creation and my desire for children and family, I create specific beings and persons (with free will) for my specific eternal purposes given to the obedient in great service and honor, and I do empower them accordingly. Therefore, I counsel you to learn my ways in salvation or choose the flames of destruction forevermore. But know, O’ fallen man, you have a choice that so suddenly now will forever change to you had a choice, and all those who will have chosen evil in finality when finality comes, will never escape their judgments eternally and forevermore. Selah.
Who are you, O' fallen man, even you who have joined yourselves to the senseless and foolish and insane rebellion of the fallen ones in all unrighteousness, greed, lust, and perversion to exalt yourselves in arrogance against the Great and Eternal God who has created your for my purposes and pleasure?
Who are you, O’ fallen man that in your ignorance and lust you would dare raise your heel against the great and eternal God of the Heaven of Heavens (even HE who gave you life) in the ways of the Satans? Therefore, understand my purposes and intent because I AM sending these Words to YOU as my final call to many of you who foolishly think you have time you do not have, and I AM even giving you words of warning in my undying love for you by reminding you once again of declarations of judgment and calamity already given that you have ignored in full that have been made by Christ Jesus in the throne and power of Yahweh, and also declared by Yahweh himself, even the Great I AM!
(Do you not understand that my declarations can never be changed?)
Yet, you even ignore the utterance of the seven thunders that I revealed to, and had John the Revelator seal up in his time until the proper times of revealing of which times are now. (And will continue until the testimony of my two witnesses are concluded in final judgment, right before the greatest tribulation ever fully falls on the unrighteous, Selah.) Even which thunders were pronounced by Yeshua HaMashiach and Yahweh, the Great I AM from my mighty throne of declaration and judgment, and that now is given by the hand of my mighty messenger by whom I send these Words of love and extremely firm and dire warnings, even so that all whoever may come should come, before judgment fully falls and there is no more time!
Therefore should you desire to escape your own judgment and eternal destruction, I do command you to make Jesus your Lord fully and without hesitation. Because, my judgments are falling and will fall

THE

on whomever they are sent, even those same judgments of condemnation that are eternally final in their finality even eternally and forevermore. Therefore, I counsel all who have not confessed Jesus the Christ as Lord from a heart full of faith to do so now, knowing that I AM he who raised him from the dead in exceedingly great power to die no more and to continue in his inheritance eternally and forevermore. Nevertheless, the vast majority will fall to great and eternal judgment exactly as written in the Holy writings of old and the Holy writings of now.
But I do come to give my warnings anyway, even after declarations of your final judgment have been declared and are already underway. Because my ways are ways of grace and mercy and love and of an eternal truth, I desire that none should perish but that all men would come to eternal salvation and restoration, even though most will refuse my offer and choose their own eternal torment and judgment instead. Although, I come to warn men, there are no warnings given that will change my judgments, nor their timing, nor their outcomes, nor my eternal plans to redeem my first-fruits, even snatching them away to fulfill their eternal inheritance before calamity falls. Selah.
And I do so send this message of love and warning in my love to evil natural man, even in the same love I send messages of love and warning to my own children who have obediently accepted Jesus the Christ; because I cause it to rain on the just and unjust alike. On account of my love for you, I do come to provide my final call before calamity strikes from my very own throne of eternal power, judgment, and declaration where my thunderous voice still thunders in great and righteous anger. Even so, because YOU REFUSE to hear me even though I have warned and warned for many, many jubilees now! Hear me and hear me well because your times of eternal destruction will be sent to bind in judgment all who love and make a lie, and who have pleasure in unrighteousness, and should you refuse me in these times of grace, you will fall to eternal judgment because there is no other choice.
Yet, in your hard-hearted blind arrogance, you reject the one person I sent for your full salvation, even Jesus the Nazarene, even that lowly Son and servant of Yahweh whom I have made a life giving spirit, even made just a little lower than Yahweh himself in my resurrection from the dead and glorification of Christ Jesus! Because I AM supreme and sovereign over all of my creation and of an eternal and unchanging truth, I AM he who sends rain on the just and unjust alike in my love for my creation, and in my ways there is never a respect of persons in my righteous judgments on my creation.
Therefore understand being a respecter of persons is one of the many polluted ways of the fallen ones, so I do come to warn even the vilest sinner amongst the dwellers on the earth before their judgment fully hits, even so they might escape in the few remaining and fleeting seconds of grace before calamity strikes. So I counsel all who hear or read these Words to turn to Jesus the Nazarene immediately, doubting nothing because for a great multitude there will not be another chance, because in their vile sins and utter disdain for all things Holy, they will fall to eternal judgment, even preserved in torment where they will await that great white throne judgment, where they shall not stand but instead be bound and delivered to the flames of punishment where their sins will be given into the flames for full recompense of justice forevermore.
Yet, you, O' fallen man, would sit in your unrighteous ways, even utterly overcome by the fallen ones in your ignorance and blindness caused by their lies, even lies you love because you do love the ways of your lies. Therefore, I have sent to the earth great and strong delusion that you all might be condemned who have pleasure in unrighteousness and refuse Jesus the Nazarene, even Yeshua HaMashiach. And as you grope

about in ignorance in your blind and hard-hearted ways, as you sit in darkness in apathy and great sin, as you go about in futility treasuring to yourselves great wrath and eternal consequence in your disobedience, I will still yet raise my voice, even sending these Words as a testimony against those who will refuse, even in hopes that you might turn to Christ Jesus, so I would save you from the judgment of the fallen ones: Selah.
O' Natural man, even all you unredeemed and impenitent children of Adam, even all whom I chastise on the earth in my love for you! Yet you have believed the stupidest lies given to you as education in your indoctrination by the fallen ones. Even an education of death given in your corrupt and corrupting institutions of death where the ways of the sodomite now rule as they mark and groom your very own children so they may feast on the innocent in their putrid lusts. Yet, you are so enamored with the pleasures of sin, and so encumbered by your greed to accumulate more wealth, that you willingly sacrifice your own children in the ways of Baal for a morsel of polluted bread. Therefore, I have allowed the fallen ones to poison your food, and I have given them your full abundance even so that the dragon, beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth may fulfill my purposes, because even my enemies obey my voice.
Because your so-called educations are spurious and corrupt by design and this because you reject the true knowledge and ways of Elohim your creator, choosing instead to be hypnotized by your black mirrors you hold ever so faithfully in hand as you go from screen to screen in the darkest ignorance. Yet you are utterly overwhelmed and blinded in cheap and fleeting pleasure as your minds are altered chemically by design by means of the devices with which you chain yourselves in sin. And so spurious knowledge causes pride and pride goes before great destruction. Understand, O' Man, that your knowledge cannot save you from my judgments, and the fallen ones judgment is now set to fall. Yet, you, O' Natural man are so utterly foolish to not understand that the fallen ones have indoctrinated you with their lies, even so that they would cause as many men as possible to join them in their inheritance of burning, putrid, and rolling brimstone. Even a harsh punishment that was made for the devil and his angels, and not Adam. Selah.
Nevertheless, by your willing consent you take great pride in your worthless secular accomplishments where you greedily gather your pretend worthless paper and your pretend worthless digits in virtual worthless accounts that will be taken from you so suddenly in judgment now, even so because these are the ways of Esau who sold his birthright for a morsel of bread. Yet, in your willing consent you allow the fallen ones to take money from you by threat of force to pay for the indoctrination of your own children in the ways of death. Even so that all who are indoctrinated in such ignorance and blindness would willingly serve the fallen ones while thinking they do God himself a great favor in their sins, as if Yahweh should step aside from his own creation and sovereignty on account of their worthless, sinful pride. Even an impossibility that can never happen, because I AM.
And in your hard-hearted ways of unrighteousness you have even lost your ears and stand deaf, dumb, and blind in your unrighteous ways that have reduced you in servitude as a slave to sin to appease the lusts of the fallen ones, who you do serve in your faithless ways. Nevertheless, the servant remains not in the house forever should he obediently choose to enter in at the only door to the heavens that I will ever open to mankind: Jesus the Christ who is also, Jesus the Messiah, whose name is also Yeshua HaMashiach, who is that great and only open door of salvation to ever be opened by my hand for the righteously faithful in Christ Jesus. Selah!

I AM, and I have sent these Words of love to the condemned by my messenger and servant, and by my messenger and servant have I sent these Words to those who will shortly be judged.
Understand all who hear these Words, that this is not a final pronouncement of judgment, that brings finality to natural man. On the contrary, this message serves to warn the disobedient and unrighteous of Secret Babylon and even all to whom these Words are sent, (and some will come to salvation in these last seconds) but also as a final testimony of warning given before judgment falls fully on Secret Babylon.
Understand, that my Words will find the eyes, ears, and hearts of those to whom they are sent, and no effort from the fallen ones, their abominations, nor their worthless and ignorant technologies can stop that which the Great I AM intends to accomplish.
And so I sign my personal love letter to the judged in hopes that by obedience to my Words sent in my love for them they would escape their judgments before that final hand strikes that final second.
And so I sign my letter of love in great Love and Eternal Authority!
I AM that I AM, and I AM Yahweh, The Great and Eternal I AM.
